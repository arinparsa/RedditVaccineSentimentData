"I am referring to the fact that after a vaccination the vaccinator puts a bandage over the site of vaccination and when you pull it off later on there is typically a little bit of dried blood on the bandage. If the intramuscular (IM) vaccine was injected perfectly at the right spot would there be no blood stain on the bandaid? 

Does this apply to other types of vaccinations like subcutaneous and intradermal? 

Basically, is it theoretically possible to completely avoid hitting any blood vessels? Or is some bleeding guaranteed to happen no matter what?

There is no clinical significance to a small drop of blood under the bandage after a vaccination under normalcircumstances. It could be significant for someone who has a clotting disorder, though that would be accounted for in advance. 


If you are squeamish at the sight of blood, as many people are, then you can take steps to avoid the sight by asking someone else to remove the bandage and wipe the area clean. I imagine that it would even be possible to do this without assistance.

I've also had IV blood draws, with no blood on the band-aid later. Those were definitely not IM sticks, but the ""hole"" was sealed over quickly by putting pressure on it (to compress the vein, which is the conduit for any blood leaking out), and then your platelets quickly form a ""plug"" at the site of the needlestick.

Conversely, you can damage some very superficial capillaries, like when you prick your finger superficially with a needle, and it can ooze quite a bit if you don't hold pressure or do anything to stop it. 🤷So subQ and intradermal injections can also have bleeding, on the same principle.",2024-05-24T18:20:28.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2024-05-24T18:20:28.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2024-05-24T18:20:28.000Z,no_vcc,na,na

They seem to be justifying not including F456L or R436T by saying these substitutions have been present in previous variants. I think this approach is short-sighted given that recent titer studies have shown a considerable drop in neutralisation with these present, likely leaving a few extra percent of infection protection on the table.

I just got my 3rd hep A+B vaccine and something strange happened during the injection. As soon as the person jabbed me I felt some 'movement' and she said, ""oh! Are you okay?"" The movement felt as if some bubbles were moving around the injection site under the skin as if trapped in water trying to get out. It's strange but that's what my mind first thought of when I felt it.

I replied that I was okay as it didn't hurt abnormally. I asked what happened and she said that the muscle must have twitched and that maybe she hit a nerve or something. She continued and finished the shot as normal.

The recommended thing during pregnancy is a pertussis booster, BUT I don't think anybody makes a pertussis-only vaccine.

Babies would get DPT (capital D = bigger dose of diphtheria). Plus babies are getting their HIB and IPV vaccines around the same time. Neither of those would be harmful to take during pregnancy, although you are not high risk for either of those things.

"I have been having an ongoing and open discussion with my SO regarding vaccines, and we have decided to be open to learning from resources supporting each of our points of view. When it comes to vaccines I am pro, and my SO is highly skeptical. I presented my SO with the information provided through the vaccine education center from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia website, after I had spent an entire delving into all of its information myself. I believed this to be a valuable resource considering it's from one the country's leading pediatric centers, and all of the information is reviewed by a notable doctor who created the Rotavirus vaccine. It breaks down the ingredients in each vaccine, why they are there, and how it affects humans. I thoroughly enjoyed furthering my education on the topic.

  
After explaining why I thought this was a good resource, my SO explained their concern that me being pro-vaccine would lead me to be bias on any resources that would be provided concerning their opinions on the subject. I told them that I would be open to reading any resource, provided the source is from a reputable doctor with proper credentials. They provided me with Dr. Kendal Stewart as a resource for their views on vaccinations. That view being that genetics plays a heavy role in how vaccines affect humans. If anyone vaccinates a baby, then genetic testing should be done on that baby prior to being poked to ensure that no adverse effects will occur. Something along those lines is how it was explained to me. I am going to listen to his podcast ""why genetic testing prior to vaccines is necessary"" to learn more of this POV. I haven't found too much negative information on Dr. Stewart's practices, but I have stumbled upon some off-putting readings regarding the treatment of autism.

That should be a pretty easy study to do, because the kids' genetic test result is gonna be the same AFTER getting the vaccine, right? So you could go test a bunch of kids who are ""vaccine injured"" and you should find that they have  the HLA B24 antigen (or whatever---I'm making that up) and that the HLA B24 antigen is absent in kids who did fine after vaccination. THEN you do a study of kids born with the antigen, WITHHOLD vaccination, and follow them to see whether they develop autism (or whatever) anyway. 

Genetics DOES play a big role in autism, but:

(a) there's no single gene to test for to predict this, and

(b) autism is not ""triggered"" by vaccines. In kids with a family history, it occurs just as often even if they are not vaccinated.

"Edit: I am going to talk to my doctor about this on thursday, Im just curious if anyone else can relate.

I initially had a bad reaction to the meningitis b vaccine, I couldnt move my arm for a few days and the vaccine site was swollen. It healed after a couple weeks, but the injection site is stiff and hard to the touch compared to the rest of my arm.

This past fall I've had my covd and flu vaccines in the same arm as the mengb vaccine. They were not unusually painful, but the pain did not fully go away. The injection site still feels tender and hard to touch, the skin is hypersensitive, and there is some discomfort deep in the muscle when pressed. Its made sleeping on my left side to be quite uncomfortable.

There is no rash or swelling, and I have full range of motion in the shoulder.

"I don't think you understand the science behind vaccines, the immune system, viruses at large. That's not giving you flak, its saying that the kind of question being asked is one that comes from a misunderstanding of the underlying mechanisms as a whole. 

""Removing a vaccine"" from the body isn't a sentence that makes sense. Vaccines don't live or remain in your body in any form. They aren't injecting particles that remain inside you or incorporate into your genome. They generally present imitations (or parts, or weakened versions) of microbes so that your immune system can make antibodies that are ready to deploy right away when it later encounters the real thing. At best, you could nuke your immune system entirely to forget everything it's learned, which would leave you vulnerable to die from even the usually-benign bacteria living on your skin as we speak. Or, you could get a bone marrow transplant and inherit someone else's immune system, perhaps... a major, major surgery with potential wild side effects reserved for people with cancer or other such dire illnesses where they need a complete immune replacement/reboot. Though, fun fact, we've seen people accidentally inherit AIDS-resistance that way. 

We do not have an undo button on our own immune system's learning, though. We can't roll back history. Now, a live real virus on the other hand, a lot of those can be with you forever in ways we don't yet have the science to undo, and something like Measles (which is coming back because of anti-vaxxeres) can damage the immune system such that it forgets everything it learned -&gt; not a boon, a serious danger that leaves kids immunocompromised.",2024-02-25T00:17:43.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2024-02-25T00:17:43.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_measles,2024-02-25T00:17:43.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_measles

"**Your question is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how vaccines work. It does not make sense from a scientific perspective.**

A vaccine does not 'stay in your system'. You can think of a vaccine as just a stimulant for your immune system. A vaccine shows your immune system what key parts of a pathogen looks like then the immune system does the work to create the immunity. Your immune system then produces antibodies &amp; t-cells as it would after a wild infection - but without having to be actually infected and risking severe illness/death.

Immunity does decrease over time, as immune cells and antibodies take energy to produce and our body has evolved to use energy wisely. Generally you body does not completely forget immunity to something unless your immune system is severely compromised, like with immune diseases or after a measles infection.

In terms of actual vaccine components, they are usually destroyed by your immune system within a few days because they are designed to be. With most vaccines a purified small portion of a virus/bacteria is injection which your immune system then looks at and generates immunity to.

The only difference with mRNA covid vaccines is that they use single-strand messenger RNA to tell your cells to produce the small portion of the virus (spike protein) which they then release and your body generates immunity to. This makes them ideal for pandemics since you don't need to spend months or years growing virus/bacteria in labs via complicated methods to produce enough vaccine, people cells can just do it instead with no ill effect. Any mRNA not taken in by cells will disintegrate on its own within about 48hrs anyway, completely harmless.",2024-02-25T00:58:18.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2024-02-25T00:58:18.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2024-02-25T00:58:18.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid

"From what I understand, GBS is an autoimmune disease where your immune system attacks your own nerves. One possible mechanism is through the creation of autoimmune triggering antibodies. When you get sick with a virus or get a vaccine, your body reacts by producing antibodies. However, antibody production has some element of randomness in it, and in some very rare cases the antibodies produced by your body to fight the pathogen can also have unintended targets. So the same structural shape of an antibody allowing it to recognize and bind to some part of the pathogen, can also happen to bind to your own tissue, like a glycolipid or surface molecule on your nerve cells. Vaccines will often have fewer targets than the full pathogen, to lower the chance of GBS and other side effects. For example we only use the S protein for the Covid vaccines, not any of the other 28 proteins that Covid viruses code for, or another example is how the acellular pertussis vaccine has fewer side effects than the cellular pertussis vaccine - at the cost of slightly less efficacy and/or wearing off faster, you get a safer vaccine.

The narcolepsy side effect discovered after the introduction of the Pandemrix H1N1 influenza-A vaccine in 2009 was a similar auto antibody effect, which is why it was pulled off the shelf and discontinued. H1N1 flu disease itself can have a similar rare effect of causing ongoing narcolepsy after recovery, and that vaccine happened to cause the same antibody production in rare cases. Just something about one of the viral protein's shapes has enough binding site similarity to some cells that it happens to cause that very unfortunate complication.",2024-02-23T18:03:09.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_influenza,2024-02-23T18:03:09.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2024-02-23T18:03:09.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

"The ""5 in 1 vaccine"" is not ""too heavy"" for a 2 month old. 

From the perspective of a person's immune system, what matters is the antigen content of a vaccine. An antigen is the specific part of a bacterial/virus/toxoid that we can't to generate immunity to. Essentially the higher the antigen content, the more the immune system has to pay attention and work.

***It has been estimated that even if you gave the entire 0-18yrs vaccine schedule at once, it would use less than 1% of a very young child's immune system capacity.***

Childhood infections that are considered 'routine' such as roseola (human herpesvirus 6), hand foot and mouth, foot and mouth, etc present a much bigger challenge to a child's immune system than any vaccine will. 

Even though we vaccinate for more individual diseases nowadays, the total antigen content for all vaccine your child will receive is actually lower than what you likely received as a child in the 80s/90s as the doses for each component have been lowered over time.

&gt; Nearly 10 000 children in Burkina Faso and Cameroon have now received the RTS,S malaria vaccine since being introduced this year. A wider malaria vaccine rollout is underway this year in several African countries, with Cameroon being the first outside the malaria vaccine pilot programme to do so.

...

&gt; Malaria burden is the highest on the African continent, which accounted for approximately 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of related deaths in 2022. **There were 249 million malaria cases globally in 2022, leading to 608 000 deaths. Of these deaths, 77% were children under 5 years of age, mostly in Africa.**

"Apologies if these sorts of questions come up a lot:

My (23m) parents did not vaccinate me as a kid but I am starting a pharmacy tech program so I got everything I was still missing: flu, then about a week later I got Hep B and MMR. Everything seemed fine at first, until about a week after. I got terrible stomach pains/fever/diarrhea/chills/tiredness. It slowly got better. After a few days I thought it was on its way out but now the left lymph node under my ear is swollen (not terribly but enough to notice), that side of my lower skull is real tender, and the stomach pains/tiredness are back especially when I lay down. Its been like this for coming up on a week now.

The few other vaccines I’ve gotten in my adult life never produced side effects like this. But I’m a little nervous because I have never gotten the MMR shot before. My first day of the program is tomorrow and I’m gonna have to get the second dose of both HEP and MMR next month. I’d hate to have to miss training days.

Thanks for all the help!

The only thing that sort of persists (to a much lesser extent) are the swollen lymph nodes which are the pea shaped things behind your ear you were talking about.

"&gt; why is it suggested as so?

Can you cite some sources that suggest herd immunity can control tetanus?

Most sources I've seen clearly acknowledge that herd immunity isn't possible for tetanus since it's not communicable. Therefore, widespread administration of the tetanus vaccine is simply to stop people from getting tetanus.

Polio rates, on the other hand, can definitely be controlled by herd immunity.

For example, the Mayo Clinic [talks about herd immunity on their COVID page](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/herd-immunity-and-coronavirus/art-20486808) and specifically mentions polio:

&gt; Herd immunity also can be reached when enough people have been vaccinated against a disease and have developed protective antibodies against future infection. Unlike the natural infection method, vaccines create immunity without causing illness or resulting complications. Using the concept of herd immunity, vaccines have successfully controlled contagious diseases such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, rubella and many others.",2024-01-09T17:49:04.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_tetanus,2024-01-09T17:49:04.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_tetanus,2024-01-09T17:49:04.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_tetanus
"The time between boosters for those vaccines that need them is based off of averages of how long the immunity lasted in the study population. I don’t recall percentages, but let’s just say they picked the point at which 50% of people had lost immunity. That means for 50% they were still immune. So the answer to your question is: no one knows without doing a titer. You could still be immune, or you could have lost your immunity a year or more ago.

As for the meningitis vaccine, correct me if this has changed, but that was aimed at college-aged people because of the congregate living situation. I don’t think it is automatically recommended to be boosted if you go on to normal living circumstances. I don’t think any of my kids kept theirs up.",2024-01-07T16:06:48.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2024-01-07T16:06:48.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_meningitis,2024-01-07T16:06:48.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_meningitis

"Last Friday our daughter received her hep A vaccine at her 2 year checkup. She was acting fine at the appt (well upset because she has learned to fear the dr). She got her shot around 4:45PM and we went out to eat after - she acted fine at the restaurant, then we went home did bedtime routine and she went down without a fuss. We did notice a tiny bit of swelling under her left eye when putter her to bed. We regretfully didn't think much of it as she is always getting little bumps and scrapes and also seems to have very sensitive skin.

Around 11:20 or so my wife went in to check on her as she was upset and not sleeping. Her face was swollen up huge mainly on the left side - her left eye was swollen shut, her left cheek was huge, lips were protruding over an inch from her face. I threw some jeans and a shirt on, my wife gave her 3.5mls of Benadryl and we rushed her to the ER - we live a good 20+ min away. She was immediately given epinephrin, steroids, and fomadatine. After an hour or so there was no improvement and they gave her another dose of epinephrine, and more Benadryl. Over the next 4 hours her face swelling gradually decreased. We left after 5 total hours the last 4 just being monitored. She seemed ""fine"" the entire time (very upset after IV and nurse/doctor interactions) she was seemingly breathing fine - her O2 was fine.

My wife and I have been going through the day of and the days leading up to this event - we have not been able to think of any new foods or potential allergens that may have caused this. We can't say with 100% certainty it was from the hep A vaccine but we are fairly confident it was a reaction from it. She did play with balloons a day prior to this happening as it was her birthday - but she has played with balloons a handful of times before with no reaction. She also had some coconut from a ice cream bar I was eating that night before bed - but again she has had coconut at least two other times with no issue.

We now have an epipen at home, and she is taking prednisone, fomadotine, and benedrly for another couple days. She has been acting pretty much normal minus a little tiredness probably from the antihistamine.

We will be seeing an allergist ASAP. My wife is now sleeping in her room that way it is easy to monitor her throughout the night.

I guess I am just looking for other parents that have been through something similar and if you have any advice. Clearly we are very worried this will happen again. If it was caused by the vaccine I am hoping that it was a one and done type event - but we don't know for sure.

Plus you mentioned the balloons, which sometimes contain latex. Just something to present to the allergist -- they can probably do a skin test for both coconut and latex allergy (they make a tiny scratch on the skin with the allergen, then you get what looks like a mosquito bite if you're allergic).

"Hi, everyone!

I have only had one flu shot in my life a few years ago (before COVID).  I had a fairly mild, but concerning reaction to it. My tongue and upper throat swelled slightly, but improved after about 15 minutes.

I know that allergies can increase in severity, particularly after first exposure and as such, I have avoided flu vaccines ever since.

I have, however, received 3 COVID vaccines. The first two were Moderna, the third Pfizer. Each dose I feel worse--nausea, chills, aches, etc. But I've never had an allergic reaction.

I know that the new vaccine is non-MRNA and I have tried to compare the ingredients between the four different sources, but I have no idea how safe the new vaccine is for me.

so, about two weeks ago, i was playing with this three week old stray puppy and i got scratched by it(very small scratch with a drop of blood coming from it). It was in my hostel area, a stray mother dog gave birth to 7 puppies out of which 2 died out of unknown reasons, they were weak from birth and its winter season now and now i got to know that one more died i dont know it was the one i played with or not, but the mother dog is still healthy and kicking with 4 pups

I completed my post exposure schedule in the month of may(5 doses) and i went to the hopsital where the doctor listened to my story and gave me a booster dose(a single one) and told its enough as i was vaccinated 6 months ago.

so i wanted to know what are the chances of getting rabies and why did he recommend only one booster dose, is one booster dose after 6 months of pep effective? its been 4 days since i took the booster, should i get another one?

"I'm currently in the middle of a year of travelling, and before I left (back in July) I got all my travel vaccines, including the first dose of the Hepatitis A vaccine.

I was told to get the second dose after 6-12 months, and I planned on getting one at the 6 month mark when I was back home for Christmas, but unfortunately I wasn't able to do that.

Over the next 6 months I'll be travelling around Asia, and as some of the countries are high risk, I was wondering how much protection I'd actually have? I'll be finished travelling by July, so around a year after I got my first dose.

I assumed that if I could get my second dose up to a year after the first dose, then within that initial year I should be adequately protected through the first dose? Other things I've read suggest protection from the first dose alone can be up to 10 years.

"My husband and I have been together for nearly 20 years. I had one deal breaker in our relationship which was a similar political belief. To each their own, but I personally could never be with someone on the opposite spectrum. Politics are just too important to me. Personal autonomy, my LGBTQ+ family etc, it’s just non-negotiable for me. And my husband strongly agrees, still does 

 Now, I’m wanting to put a line in the sand on the dealbreaker. To be clear, to each their own in politics, but in our relationship we have always seen eye to eye more or less and it was always a dealbreaker for me that we generally agreed in politics. I know for some couples that’s not important but it is for me. But, it was a clear deal breaker when we moved across country for a new job that he couldn’t be “red-pilled”. He was joining a “Christian” job. The job was good, his boss is good, and I’m actually a very spiritual person who considers myself a Christian in essence. But, I’m very critical of today’s Christians and before he took the job I made it very clear that any sort of red-pill, right wing, etc, was a dealbreaker for me.


And he, a less spiritual and self-admitted far less educated on religion, politics and propaganda, always said if “they get to me, please pull me back”. Well, it’s happening. I’ve noticed it for over a year but tonight we had an all out. He had no issues whatsoever getting our Covid vaccines and boosters a couple years ago. Today, he said no to the new booster. WTF?! I’m severely disabled with an autoimmune disorder. I’m at high risk every day he goes to work but I understand the necessity. But who is this anti-vaccine nut I’ve known for 20 years?


He’s always been smart and we knew these people he worked with were likely anti-vaccine when he went to work there. But he happily said, I’m just not that guy, and got his vaccines. They got in his head. I’m losing my mind that he is really changing his position after all these years and what we said before he started working there. As we argued, I said this one is my line in the sand. He very surprisingly said okay, fine. Dealbreaker, I guess. I don’t know if he meant it, but I said we could not stay together if this is where he is headed (I was in absolute shock, not thinking straight, just brought up going to get our boosters) and he said “fine” with disdain 

I’m absolutely shook. Literally talking about separating over this. I can’t believe they got to him. Help? What can I do? What info can I give him?  I never thought it was possible to get really get to him. I thought I’d be able to intervene if he was getting bad info. He always trusted my educated opinion before. Now he has all these new voices telling him otherwise that he believes and it hurts like hell. He said he would trust me if I told him he was getting caught up in the right wing nonsense and anti-vaccine is the gateway. He thinks it’s because it’s “different” than voting MAGA he knows what he’s talking about. I can’t get across that anti-vaccine is the gateway and also puts me at high risk. 

Please help. I need talking points and succinct scholarly articles. I need medical studies from respected journals. He’s in a medical field and therefore thinks he just knows better than I do. Unfortunately, my love of 20 years is, as I know, very susceptible to bad information if it “just makes sense” and he’s surrounded by it. It’s the reason I put up so many “what-if’s” before we moved. It’s like I knew this could happen but I just thought he might become a nutty Christian where I could appeal to him better because I have a theology education and cult “expertise”. I can’t fight vaccines because I’m not in the medical field. I just know I’m at medical risk, and nearly everyone smarter than myself says get a damn booster.

"No. The ones in red are 80-98% immune (to the childhood illnesses we vaccinate for. When talking about flu or covid, there will never be anything close to herd immunity as they mutate too quickly and our vaccines can’t keep up.) Even if one in ten of the folks in red aren’t actually immune, with high enough vaccinated numbers, we’ve achieved herd immunity. That doesn’t mean zero infections, it just means any one outbreak will be limited. 

Measles is a great example in the US. We hear about measles outbreaks in some city/school district, but the outbreak stays limited to that area, or if someone travels while infected, two areas. It doesn’t spread into the wider community as long as that community has a high vaccination rate. Since antivax people often congregate in a school or community, you’ll see 5-10 cases clustered, but then it dies out. This is exactly what herd immunity aims to do.

It sounds as if you are doubting that vaccines provide actual immunity. That is entirely dependent on the pathogen we are talking about and the vaccine in use. MMR vaccines are highly effective when given and boosted on schedule, providing life-long immunity to 96-98% of people for measles and rubella, and 80-85% for mumps. No one who catches it remains asymptomatic (at least not that I’ve heard of.) Either you have immunity and don’t become infected, or you aren’t immune and you may become infected and pass it along.
 
COVID is both a more rapidly mutating virus than those others, and the vaccines are also less effective as we just aren’t there yet with corona viruses and influenza viruses.

No idea what the book was about but I immediately told him it was questionable because it had a blurb on the cover from Marianne Williamson. I basically told him she was a healing cancer with crystals nut and he was like “oh? I had no idea”. He just doesn’t know things, like questionable stuff. When I tell him, he generally believes me. He was sadly recommended a friggin Jordan Peterson book on audible. He was listening to the first chapters and I cut that off and I literally made him listen to the Maintenance Phase podcast so he understood he was a nut. And then he was like, “oh, damn.

I'd also suggest Dr Eric Topol's posts on X and substack.

You are seeking evidence, but as I suspect you know, it might not be evidence that wins this disagreement.  Being anti-vaxx may make your husband feel smart and in-the-know, despite being deeply misinformed.  So a question to explore is: how does being anti-vaxx make him feel?

It is amazingly frustrating and mind-boggling to watch someone fall into this and be able to do nothing. Being anti-anything is easier to defend (even when dead wrong) than pro. That’s one reason real scientists won’t debate anti-vaxxers. Half-truths and misinterpretations are so easy to throw out and hard to dispute unless people will really listen and get past the lizard-brain gut reactions. I HATE when people say “follow your gut” since that is so often simply flight or fight BS.

"Yes, that is the Fluzone HD, High dose, to better stimulate the older immune system. Simply more of the inactivated flu particles in the shot.

I understand your father’s hesitancy, but catching the flu without having the vaccine can be deadly for elders. He can request the low dose, or try the high dose again, but not getting vaccinated is risking much worse than some side-effects. I want to assure you and him that the vaccine did not give him the Flu. It is inactivated, and while it can cause similar reactions in some people, that is the response of your immune system, not the effects of being infected. Vaccines may cause one death in 100,000,000 doses (usually from anaphylaxis) the flu will cause 1 death in less than 100 cases among those over 65, and hospitalization in over 25 of 100 infections.

"You didn't answer OP's questions, you just replied with nonsense fearmongering.

It's a rabies vaccine. There is ZERO leeway with rabies. The trade-off for making sure you don't die from rabies is that there might or might not be side-effects from the vaccine. But guess what? You'll still be alive after the side-effects go away.

Rabies, on the other hand, *is fatal*. Once you develop symptoms, *you cannot be saved*. You don't get a second chance with rabies, and you can't argue, debate, or lie your way out of dying. There is no treatment (the Milwaukie Protocol doesn't work, btw) and the only thing left for you once it manifests is palliative care to lessen your suffering as you die.

Rabies is still a huge killer in many parts of the world. Maybe you live somewhere that your chance of contracting rabies is extremely low and you get to pretend like it doesn't matter that it exists. But for people who live where rabies is common, you either get the preventative vaccine or you risk dying one of the most horrific deaths possible. Look up what happens to you when you get rabies. It's not pleasant.

And if you've possibly been exposed to rabies, it's simply not worth the risk of not getting the post-exposure vaccine. Would you rather go through some temporary side-effects to be 100% sure you don't die of rabies, or would you rather gamble with your life and be wrong?

Are you educated whatsoever in virology, immunology, epidemiology, medicine? You seem to get your medical information from newsletters run by quacks and other nonsensical sources. Mumps, for example, predates Christ's (alleged) birth. It is a virus and not cause by heavy metals OR pesticides. In what way are you qualified to weigh in on 150 years or rabies (or other) vaccination research and the advancements thereof? You clearly aren't.

So don't come in here with your vague, uninformative language and mealy-mouthed equivocation. I hate vaccine misinformation, especially so in this case. To quote Kyle Reese from *The Terminator*, rabies ""absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!"" 

Trying to convince people not to get rabies vaccines is despicable, antisocial behavior.",2023-12-24T16:21:18.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_unknown,2023-12-24T16:21:18.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_unknown,2023-12-24T16:21:18.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_rabies

It seems premature to panic and complain when the program is available right now and a lot can change between now and then. 

The article is panicking and complaining about just about everything, in fact.

" Just so everyone here is aware:

If you are HSV2 positive, some exciting vaccines are on the horizon.  

Over the last few weeks, both GSK and Moderna have updates on their therapeutic vaccines.  
Moderna is recruiting for their mRNA genital herpes therapeutic vaccine. They expect this vaccine to have efficacy similar to daily antivirals for suppressing lesions. They are also measuring shedding in their study. This is the first attempt at such a  vaccine to treat existing GHSV2.[https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06033261?cond=HSV-2&amp;aggFilters=phase:0%201%202&amp;rank=6](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06033261?cond=HSV-2&amp;aggFilters=phase:0%201%202&amp;rank=6)

  
GSK is testing a therapeutic/treatment vaccine for those diagnosed with genital herpes. This phase I/II study is expected to end in 2026  and is recruiting. They also developed the Shingrix vaccine,  which addresses herpes zoster and is 97% effective. Since HSVI/II are cousins to this virus, many predict this vaccine will be highly successful - but only the trials will let us know for sure! You can read about the clinical trial here: [https://www.gsk-studyregister.com/en/trial-details/?id=215336](https://www.gsk-studyregister.com/en/trial-details/?id=215336).

&amp;#x200B;

Harvey  Friedman at the University of Pennsylvania has developed a  prophylactic  (preventative) vaccine for those not already infected with HSV  in partnership with BioNtech. This is also currently in trials. [https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05432583](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05432583)

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone reading lives near any of the trial sites, consider joining!  Click on those links to see if you might be an eligible candidate.  Though it will take a few years, we are closer than ever to having effective breakthroughs in treating GHSV I and II. These vaccines could significantly reduce stigma and provide millions with peace of mind and comfort!

"Hello! I'm wondering if anyone here has gone through this. My 4 month + 2 weeks (3 months + 1 week corrected age) got his 4 month vaccine 5 days ago. The first night his fever was 38.6 then 20ish min later 39.3...we gave him Tylenol as directed by the pharmacist. It did go down a bit but still stayed a low grade fever. We gave him Tylenol on and off until Sunday. Maybe 4 or 5 doses in those few days. He started acting himself again yesterday and smiling and all his energy and more so again today. But the fever keeps coming back. It's on/off. It seems to start back around noonish. His pediatrician is on vacation and emergency appointment is always booked even when you call at the opening hours. I don't want to go to ther ER since the last 2 days it doesn't go above 38.3 but I'm scared and not sure how normal this is. He was born at 34 weeks, IUGR, even a hernia surgery at 6 weeks old so I can't help but worry. He eats well and otherwise I wouldn't even realize he had the fever if I wasn't checking.",2023-09-20T17:26:38.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown,2023-09-20T17:26:38.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown,2023-09-20T17:26:38.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown

"Your pediatrician would have a nurse on the staff, or another pediatrician, able to answer questions by phone. Alternatively, how about try immediate care? Usually they accept kids, too, though you might call and ask beforehand.

"From the article - 

&gt; ""CDC is now recommending updated COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 6 months and older to better protect you and your loved ones,"" CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen said in a release after signing off on the panel's recommendations.

&gt; The CDC committee voted in favor of ""universal"" recommendations for the shots to all Americans who are eligible, after weighing data and modeling backing the need for the new shots.

&gt; ""The public can be assured that these updated vaccines have met the agency's rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality. We very much encourage those who are eligible to consider getting vaccinated,"" Dr. Peter Marks, director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a news release announcing the move. 

[...]

&gt; The new shots are similar to previously approved formulas but were updated to target the XBB variants — strains of the virus descended from the original Omicron variant — which became dominant last winter. 

&gt; Newer descendant strains have since emerged, though vaccine makers have announced early findings suggesting their shots will also work for the latest strains on the rise.

&gt; ""We've been able to demonstrate, in a clinical study, that robust neutralizing antibody titers are induced against XBB.1.5, closely related variants such as XBB.1.16, and more distant variants, including EG.5.1, FL.1.5.1 and BA.2.86,"" Moderna's Frances Priddy told the panel Tuesday, presenting the company's findings.",2023-09-13T08:48:24.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2023-09-13T08:48:24.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2023-09-13T08:48:24.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid
"The answer is, ""pretty darn good."" There are even studies going on to see whether a single dose of vaccine will be adequate. And the recommendation may evolve to being two doses (not three) after the age of 21

"Right, and I'm sure OP doesn't want to get warts, but if they've proven that CIN, when present, DOESN'T turn into cancer, that's what I'd call Pretty Darn Good. 

I think another consideration in all of this is that the Partial/Pretty Good protection may be adequate on a population basis, as more &amp; more people get the vaccine. Like in the US, when they cut down from 5 doses of polio, to just 4 (in the 90s, I think). The rationale being that the cost of giving another dose to every single kid---to bring our population immunity from 98 to 99.5% or whatever---to guard against the diminishingly small risk that ANY US kid would be exposed to polio, let alone the 1.5% of kids who were sub-optimally immune. 

Or like, if there's limited supply of vaccine (as with the UK in the early days of COVID vaccine) or limited funds to spend on administrative costs &amp; blahblahblah, it's better to give MORE people ONE dose, than to duplicate the effort trying to give SOME of the people their second or third dose (when a good proportion of them are already immune from the first dose).

&lt;&lt; None of which answers the OPs question of : am \*\*I\*\* immune? I think these recommendations are based on risk/benefit deliberation for big populations.",2023-09-17T19:27:43.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2023-09-17T19:27:43.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2023-09-17T19:27:43.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_HPV

"Yeah, good luck with that. You're unlikely to find a good randomized study that will address your situation today, because:

* The initial studies did Phase I to set a dose &amp; schedule, and then they just tested everybody with that dose.
* Anyone who inadvertently (against recommendations &amp; protocal) only got 1 or 2 doses, was probably different from the people who completed the series, right? I mean, they didn't intentionally randomise some people to just get one or two doses. The people who ""dropped out"" of the planned study, may have had health problems or barriers to access, that kept them from completing. So their outcomes wouldn't be a good apples-to-apples comparison group. 
* And even the initial studies from 20 years ago, would yield different results if done today. Like, the original Gardisil was against types 6, 11, 16 &amp; 18, because those were the most prevalent at the time. But they've gone down in prevalence since then, so the ""benefit"" of the vaccine---and the difference between the 1-dose, 2-dose, &amp; 3-dose groups would be smaller today, than what was shown in those studies. 🤷",2023-10-25T16:10:24.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2023-10-25T16:10:24.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_HPV,2023-10-25T16:10:24.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_HPV

I also work in a healthcare setting where I administer various vaccinations to adolescents. I have noticed that the HPV vaccine is commonly declined.

"This is actually pretty interesting and prescient. Just today I was reading some quotes from Dr. Offit, whom I also think is a very important titan in the field, that nobody under 75 should be expecting to get the updated Covid booster. This was really a big surprise to me. The provided rationale was that previous boosters do an OK job of preventing hospitalization and death.  I felt that the subtext is that any effects of Covid short of landing you in the hospital are your own problem to deal with. (You can end up with pulmonary or heart problems, arrhythmia, sensory effects like long term smell and taste loss or hearing loss, etc., and since most such health problems don't lay you out in the hospital, those issues seem not to be even a part of the discussion.)

The exact same reasoning was provided by ex-FDA scientists Marion Gruber and Philip Krause when they wrote a Lancet article back in 2021 saying that we shouldn't be giving any boosters at all. Well, the boosters were approved anyway (and those two quit the FDA over the disagreement with the administration and others in public health on the issue). The data on the booster turned out to show that it was hugely important and did a lot of heavy lifting even to prevent hospitalization and death, and that the 2-shot series was basically quite insufficient in the long run. In other words, the very thing that they claimed it wasn't needed for, it was needed for. 

The FDA vaccine advisory committee last year was talking about moving to an Covid annual booster. I wonder what happened to that strategy, and is the age 75 thing being pushed by others in the field. I hope that the ACIP committee next week hears a variety of public health scientist voices and considers the best data available, when devising a strategy. I disagree that we should all just be happy occasionally contracting the disease again to shore up our immunity - we don't use that strategy for the flu.",2023-09-07T04:32:11.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2023-09-07T04:32:11.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid,2023-09-07T04:32:11.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

"TDaP Vaccine During Pregnancy

This is not asking what I should do, as I am in discussion with my OB and family doctor, but links to research or answers to questions about the mechanisms of TDaP vaccine during pregnancy.

What crosses the placenta to the fetus: just the antibodies produced by the mother or the antigens and adjuvants and other components as well?

If the mother knows she is not allergic to the TDaP, how does she know her fetus is not allergic to the TDaP… they have DNA from the father too. For example, when a child goes for their DTaP if they have an allergic reaction, it is witnessed and they can take epinephrine and be treated immediately. 

Would there be any signs if a fetus was having seizures or in distress? How would a pregnant woman know if the fetus wasn’t moving due to distress, as fetuses sleep a lot.

"The value is ALL in being ""part of something bigger."" The compensation is only intended to offset your time, travel expenses, and hassle of participating in the study; they are ethically not allowed to pay you huge amounts.

There's a tiny chance that you may benefit (if the vaccine is effective, AND if you were otherwise destined to develop CMV during a future pregnancy). And there's a tiny chance that you may be harmed (like if the vaccine later is shown to cause myocarditis in 1 of every 20,000 people, like the mRNA covid vaccines).

Even if they find out that the vaccine doesn't work, it gets them closer to finding one that DOES work. It's like Edison said about the light bulb.

Got 3 doses of vaccine against TBE (in my left arm) and the day after I got 3 small swollen lymph nodes near my RIGHT armpit. Have had them for weeks now. Just one tiny one on the left side. Swollen lymph nodes are a rarer but possible side effect of the TBE vaccine.

"I ASSUME you mean the doc said you CAN get it now, but you will NOT be ""allowed""/covered to get it after  you turn 40? 

The HPV vaccines prevent several strains of the HPV virus, which can cause warts and cancer. It's a slow virus, though, and, it takes many years to develop cancer. (Most people have more sex partners when they are younger, and then they ""settle down;"" yet cervical cancer incidence peaks in the 50's). So if you get the vaccine when you're 80, it is very unlikely to benefit you because:

* MOST 80-year-olds have fewer partners than when they were younger, and
* The older you get, the higher the likelihood that you have already contracted the virus, and
* IF you contract it for the first time at an older age, you are unlikely to develop cancer from it within your remaining life expectancy

To your specific questions: There is no evidence that the vaccine's protection wanes or decreases with age. It's only been on the market for 17 years, so MAYBE it wanes in 50 years? But no evidence of that yet. 

It has been shown that young girls get a better ""immune response"" when vaccinated, than older girls---meaning they have equivalent titers of antibody after receiving only two shots, whereas older (over age 14) girls don't achieve those titers until the third shot.

"&gt;hysteria among anti-vaxxers regarding COVID shots, claiming that these shots are what have been causing a surge in heart-related complications like myocarditis

Yes...

&gt;and deep vein thrombosis in many celebrities (Jamie Foxx, D'amar Hamlin, Al Roker, etc).

...and no.

To my knowledge, Jamie Foxx hasn't revealed what his diagnosis even is. Al Roker had a pulmonary embolism at age 66 (in addition to a [long &amp; complicated medical history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Roker)), and Damar Hamlin had a commotio cordis injury. None of these are known to be linked to the vaccine.

The way you determine what is linked (correlated) to the vaccine, is by seeing what is increased across large populations. Take Roker's pulmonary embolism: That happens to 900,000 people in the US every year, and it has not increased with the vaccine (well, it has continued the slow increase that had started pre-COVID, but nothing more). So we all know that correlation doesn't prove causation, but if there's *not even any correlation present* in the first place, then you don't need to investigate further.

In contrast, there were cases of myocarditis being reported in vaccinated teenage &amp; young adult men in about April of 2021. It's about 1 in 20,000 in 17-yr-olds, so it didn't show up in the first several-thousand people vaccinated (most of whom are some other age that 17).

There is no increase in healthy athletes dropping dead, or collapsing as Bronny James did, since COVID &amp; the vaccine. We don't know his whole history, and I think it's creepy to speculate about individuals, but people with myocarditis usually have pain at rest or with minimal activity. They don't show up for practice feeling fine, and then suddenly drop.

What I hope-against-hope that this WILL highlight, is the baseline number of athletes who have dropped dead over the years, and the screening that has been recommended for competitive athletes &amp; family members of those affected.

&gt;what is the likelihood of suffering from these complications years after taking the vaccine?

Of course the idea of LaTe-OnSeT cOmPlIcAtIoNs is another talking point for anti-vaxxers, but studies of large populations have shown that the myocarditis risk is concentrated in the first couple weeks after the mRNA vaccines. Which means: COULD it happen three weeks after vaccine? Sure, maybe. Or SIX MONTHS after? Highly unlikely. Or TEN years after? I'll be the first to admit that we haven't followed anyone for ten years after the vaccine, but no vaccine, ever, has caused late side effects. So, basically, no. If you get myocarditis, or anything else, ten years after your vaccine, you should consider the baseline rate of that thing in the population.",2023-07-27T03:04:08.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid,2023-07-27T03:04:08.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2023-07-27T03:04:08.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid
"There are too many arguments against and for the vaccine. I was scared of covid AND I was scared of the vaccine. I chose not to take the vaccine due to what our province's heath doctor said. Before the vaccines came out, we were told that unless we had comorbidities, or were in our senior years, just stay home and heal up, then go back to work unless you have respiratory problems, as it is no worse than a flu and we don't want to unnecessarily overwhelm the healthcare system. That's when I realized that it wasn't too serious for most healthy people. When the vaccines came out, there was a lot of controversy around how fast they came out and the possible rushed testing on a new type of experimental vaccine. So, knowing that this was not much worse than a flu for healthy people, and I felt there were unanswered questions about the vaccine, my wife and I decided to opt out. We never got sick, but it seemed like as soon as the vaccines came out, everybody got sick. My observations tell me that something was wrong. I work in a big plant that has 1200 people employed in it. About 10% of us didn't get the vaccine. Although some of the 10% got sick, it was no worse than a mild flu. But those who were vaccinated were very sick, and kept getting sick over and over again. There are a lot of people in my plant that said they only took the vaccine because the government made it impossible to travel, got out to restaurant's or join in with a lot of activities. Most did not do it for their health. Many of them are quite pissed off that the vaccines didn't work. Presently, the vaccines are getting a reputation of causing a rise in all-cause morbidities.

"&gt;I mentioned Jamie Foxx because he was vaccinated a few weeks before his collapse during a movie set. This would provide evidence of potential short term vaccine side effects

No, it wouldn't provide evidence of that. You have to figure (LET'S ASSUME he had a stroke; I hate speculating about people...)

* every year 800,000 Americans have strokes (0.2% of the population)
* **If we give a shot of SALINE to 70% of the population (null hypothesis), then there will still be 800,000 strokes in the next year, right?** And
* 70% of those strokes (560,000 strokes) will occur in people who got the saline shot. 
* And those 560,000 strokes could occur pretty evenly/ randomly throughout the year. Like, 1,534 strokes per day. 
* So by random chance, 1,534 x 21 = 32,219 people will have a stroke WITHIN THREE WEEKS after their saline shot

So when you point to one person having a terrible thing happen within three weeks of their vaccine, that alone is not ""evidence"" that the shot causes this particular bad outcome. Substitute ""myocarditis"" or ""blood clot"" in the above analysis; the numbers are different, but the principle is the same.

...Add in the 800,000 cardiac deaths per year in the US...and the 1.9 million new cancer diagnoses---this is all BASELINE, pre-covid---and you can see that a lot of people are going to get some kind of bad news within the next year. And they're ALL gonna be saying ""Why me?"" and ""This isn't supposed to happen, this isn't normal..."" and so on. And if 70% of them have just taken a new medication/ vaccine, they'll naturally think of that as a possible cause. That's understandable, but it's not actually evidence.

That's why I say you have to look at the whole population, and show that 

* strokes or pulmonary embolism or whatever, is actually INCREASING on a population-wide basis. And then after that, 
* you have to break it down to see if it happens more in the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. Remember, at least 70% of heart attacks &amp; strokes are going to occur in the vaccinated, BECAUSE most of us are vaccinated. 
* THEN you have to age-adjust the populations, because older/sicker people were more likely to be vaccinated, and those are the people more likely to have strokes.

&gt;My concern lies mostly in the long term effects of the vaccine which can take years to show. I agree with you that the chances of side effects years after the shot can coagulate your blood are low, but not impossible... Maybe it’s the availability heuristic which is making me so worried.

I agree. The availability heuristic is amplified by goofballs on reddit saying it *must* be the vaccine. They aren't asking what his cholesterol was, or his blood pressure, or all those other things that we ALREADY KNOW are causing 800,000 strokes per year. There's also the base-rate fallacy (basically, subconsciously assuming that there are ZERO strokes at baseline because ""this isn't normal, this isn't supposed to happen..."") when actually black men in their 50s are known to have strokes at a certain rate. 🤷

&gt;The most dreadful part of all this is that there is truly no way to know if you’ll suffer these side effects until they just happen to you one day.

I can't offer you certainty on any of these questions, because I'm not clairvoyant. But I can tell you that there is no evidence that the vaccine causes strokes.

"Few problems: 
1) How can they say “vaccines” (in plural) don’t cause autism if not all vaccines have be tested for such a link? 
2) These studies do not involve inert saline placebos in order to ascertain true causation. Inert saline placebo studies are the gold standard according to the highest ranks in medicine. If you don’t use a substance that causes zero adverse reactions, then it’s a faulty study. 

Has anybody seen what Stanley Plotkin said in regards to this topic? He clearly stated that there has been no study to objectively conclude that vaccines don’t cause autism, despite what the CDC says. And he believes it’s more important to say things that aren’t true in order to inoculate the public to prevent disease. 

Having said this, I’m still trying to understand how people think it’s “settled” when “settled” is itself an unscientific term, especially when there has been no studies done to settle the debate. So far none of the sources above have answered this question.

In regards to the article you linked about it being unethical to randomize children into an unvaccinated group, that’s a silly argument. Every trial has willing participants. It’s not unethical to give a placebo to a healthy individual who may or may not get a disease for a treatment that may or may not work and may or may not be safe. This isn’t some black and white rebuttal that “shuts down” the placebo argument. So many what-ifs to avoid doing a study. Just do the study.

Of course you don't watch this stuff yourself, it was probably tweeted by some antivaxer you follow, to try to capture out of context quotes (and in this case it's a deposition so the lawyer asking the questions is regularly misrepresenting the statement just made by the Dr. Plotkin, and you are listening to the lawyer's misrepresentation).

"[We already have vaccines developed against H5N1](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/prevention.htm), but there is no reason to distribute them now because H5N1 has never spread between people, and if it ever did spread between people, we should tailor the vaccine to the strain that actually spreads. The seasonal flu vaccine manufacturing capacity could be pretty easily changed to H5N1 production.

If you want to help yourself just get the seasonal flu vaccine when it's available and stay up to date on Covid-19 vaccines. Those are both orders of magnitude more risk than a virus that has never spread between people.

Since your question is actually about developing the vaccine, the CDC has some information about developing the lab-based candidate virus for use in attenuation and vaccine creation [here](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/candidate-vaccine-virus.htm). If you wanted to develop an mRNA based vaccine, it's a lot easier, you just need the genetic sequence of whatever H5N1 strain starts spreading (in a hypothetical situation), and use the sequence for its hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins (the H and N in H5N1) for the mRNA production. Other than the sequence the rest of the vaccine will be really similar to any other mRNA vaccine, delivery via lipid particles, etc. (There's a few more details, like you might want to add a few stabilizing mutations to the sequences to make the vaccine more effective.)",2023-06-07T18:49:24.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_influenza,2023-06-07T18:49:24.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_influenza,2023-06-07T18:49:24.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_influenza

"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a tragic loss of life. I myself and my close friends and family were lucky enough to escape relatively unscathed, a by-product of this though is that the pandemic is already starting to feel like a distant memory.

One explanation for this is that human beings are notoriously poor at evaluating risk, and a personal connection to a problem makes it seem more real.

Here's the clincher though, as set out in this ' back of the envelope ' calculation from a late 2020 article from The Philadelphia Inquirer, the odds that a given American would personally know someone who had severe COVID were about fifty fifty.

"" As for the math of not knowing someone with severe COVID-19, let’s take it step by step. To determine the chance that two events will occur, you multiply the probability of one by the other. Such as when you flip a coin once, the chance of getting heads is 50%. Flip it twice, and the chance of getting heads both times is 50% times 50% — 25%... So far in the United States, one in roughly 800 people has been hospitalized, meaning the chance that a given person has not been hospitalized is 799 out of 800 (99.9%). So the chance that any two people have not been hospitalized is 799/800 times 799/800 — 99.7%""

...the average American knows about 600 people, as researchers at Columbia and Princeton Universities have calculated. Take 799/800 raised to the 600th power (multiplied by itself 600 times), and the result is close to 50% — i.e., there is about a 50-50 chance that the “average” person does not know someone who was hospitalized with COVID-19.""

Anyone who had COVID will know that the illness was real and was no joke. We would do well to remember that and reflect on the fact that one personal experience is not indicative of objective reality.",2023-06-04T12:30:37.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2023-06-04T12:30:37.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2023-06-04T12:30:37.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid
"It's an idea, but kind of out of date perspective at this point. You're using numbers from 2020. By now we've had over 6 million hospitalizations or about 1 in 55 people in the US has been hospitalized from Covid. It's hard not to know someone who was hospitalized. Most eventually got better. However, if it's not you then the fact that so-and-so got hospitalized kind of fades in your memory once it's over. Among the several people that I know that were hospitalized, a colleague of mine in his 60's was in the ICU for 5 days in December, 2022 (which was over a year after the spread of Omicron, so even Omicron is not a mild disease).

I think another aspect of the puzzle is that most people have actually contracted and recovered from Covid by now. Many people have an expectation that everyone will experience the same thing -- but they don't, the outcomes have always been, and still are, quite variable.",2023-06-05T19:58:02.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2023-06-05T19:58:02.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2023-06-05T19:58:02.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

"Thanks for your reply. My understanding is that the newspaper's calculation works as follows:

• 1 in 800 chance that a person is hospitalised with COVID;  therefore 

• 799 in 800 chance that a person is *not* hospitalised with COVID ; therefore

• (799/800) x (799/800) gives you the probability that any two people have *not* been hospitalised. 
Mathematically this is analogous to working out the chances of two coin flips as per my first post,  (1/2) x (1/2) = 25% . So if you were to pick one person, and then another person from this hypothetical eight hundred people sample in the COVID example , the chance that they both *won't* have COVID is 99.7% 

• Now imagine you personally know 600 of the people in this 800 sample size. Assuming you were to do this third step outlined above six hundred times - to represent you knowing those 600 people - then the chances that you personally know the unlucky one person who was hospitalised with COVID are calculated by (799/800) x by itself 600 times. This very roughly comes to about 50%. 

• Therefore if you were to pick 600 people from the 800 sample it would be fifty fifty that you'd personally know the one person hospitalised COVID. This is assuming that there is a 1/800 chance that this could happen and on the basis that you know 600 people.",2023-06-04T14:23:12.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2023-06-04T14:23:12.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2023-06-04T14:23:12.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

"I evaluated that an experimental drug was more dangerous than something that was compared to a flu by our province's own health doctor. We were OK until the vaccine came out; that's when covid accelerated. I listened to a few doctors on both sides of the issue. I went with those that specialized in virology and that were independent and held no bias to the government or big pharma. Now it's all over, and I hear the different claims (true or not). My wife and I are very happy with our safer choice. Many people die of the flu, and that is what this was; a bad flu. So if you were a unhealthy person, you probably would have been safer to get the vaccine. If you were healthy, your immune system could take care of it like it has all of your life. I wonder why it is, that my wife and I never get the flu shot, yet get a mild flu once in a decade. I also wonder why, when people get the flu shot, they still get the flu every year.

"For some percentage of people, vaccines including varicella don't always ""take"", i.e. provide long-lasting immunity. It could be just a person's biology or the way it was administered, or the wrong vaccine was given, or it wasn't refrigerated properly, and so on. On a population basis this isn't a big deal as we make sure that the riskiest time in a person's life is covered by the vaccine. I think varicella is thought to work for about 10-20 years of immunity.

"No, as far as I know there are only vaccines against bacterial meningococcal disease. The confusion is probably due to the fact that ""meningitis"" means an inflammation of the brain, which could be due to multiple pathogens including the amoeba you mentioned, or a virus, or bacteria, or even a reason that is not pathogen related. Meningococcal is a bacteria that often causes meningitis, so people mix up terminology and sometimes call the vaccine a ""meningitis"" vaccine. So there isn't a vaccine for the amoeba, instead you could just look at the CDC's information on staying safe [here](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/swimming.html).",2023-04-24T19:41:57.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_meningitis,2023-04-24T19:41:57.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_meningitis,2023-04-24T19:41:57.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_meningitis

Why do you say they downplay the consequences? They look for 1/million reactions like clotting with the adeno vaccines or myocarditis with the rna vaccines.

"I think antivaxxers see claims like ""safe and effective""  as a dodge at best, and an outright lie at worse. So, the vaccine isn't 100% safe, if it causes myocarditis in some people. And it isn't 100% effective, if there are examples of vaccines failure.

"I'm just telling you, that's how I've had antivaxxers explain it to me. ""We were LIED TO!"" ...because one in a million people got CVST or something.

"I always felt that it was 2nd tier messaging, like punditry, bloggers, or even social media discussions, that were not understanding the utility of the vaccine. 

I remember during the very first initial rollout in early 2021, before the virus evolved and when people really could expect 95% effectiveness for many months, there were discussions on reddit along the lines of ""I can't believe I got Covid after being vaccinated, I was told it was 95% effective and therefore impossible for me to get sick"". Uh, hmm, 95 doesn't equal 100. 1 in 20 is an amazing reduction in risk but for a very transmissible virus it will still mean it's it's not that unusual to get sick if not taking other precautions. (Nowadays the viral evolution has changed the effectiveness against symptomatic infection, but against serious infection it still holds up.)

And it was public health officials themselves that have been bringing any side effects discovered to public's attention, with an analysis of what it means for the risk-benefit calculation. This is why dosing and number of doses authorized is different by age range and health status. If the recommendation stands, the FDA advisory committee has already figured out it's still a net benefit for you to get it.

"This is a very enlightening article, thanks for posting it!

I think around 1954, my father and uncle were given the Salk vaccine during the trials. I guess polio had really sickened some friends of the family so it was a big issue my grandparents wanted to protect their kids for and be a part of solving. This article explains well the comparison between the Salk and Sabin vaccines.

There was also a good point about recent vaccine hesitancy, something I had also thought of but this put it well:

NBC News even did a whole [podcast series](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/truthers-tiffany-dover-is-dead/id1618512442) about the incident last year (I just found out about it so haven't listened yet),2023-04-10T20:15:54.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2023-04-10T20:15:54.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2023-04-10T20:15:54.000Z,no_vcc,na,na
"The tl;dr is that [vasovagal syncope](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/v/vasovagal-syncope.html) is a real condition in which some people will faint upon certain triggers that may be things like emotional distress, or seeing blood, or even getting injections/vaccinations. A nurse who was one of the first ever Covid vaccine recipients, televised on December 17, 2020, had a fainting spell from syncope on camera, and it led to endlessly circulating conspiracy theories that she was dead by the vaccine. But she wasn't, she woke up right after and was fine, if embarrassed. Yet quickly after, she basically had to go into hiding because ""participatory"" conspiracy theorists hounded her and her family. In response, her employer basically issued her a gag order and said under no circumstances could she post anything about the incident, and that they'd handle it. But their video response about the incident was very sloppy and poorly done, and made the rumors worse. So basically for years she has still not really been able to claim her life back.

Quote from the article:

&gt; I’d been following Tiffany since that day, Dec. 17, 2020. Like thousands of others, I first saw her on a livestream during the national rollout of Covid vaccines to front-line workers, where Tiffany became one of the first people in the U.S. to get a shot. I was also watching when she fainted immediately after, launching a wave of misinformation and conspiracy theories that would eventually unravel her life. 

&gt; The modern anti-vaccine movement was powered by unverified stories of the dead and damaged. Tiffany wasn’t the first person to be swallowed up in an anti-vaccine propaganda campaign, and she wouldn’t be the last.",2023-04-10T20:35:07.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid,2023-04-10T20:35:07.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid,2023-04-10T20:35:07.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

"I hate to say ""I told you so...""

This is all over the place on the anti-vax boards, with people saying ""I was banned/deleted for saying *what happened to me*. I was told that *my personal experience was 'misinformation*.'

&gt;It’s not misinformation if that’s actually what happened to me.

I mean, sure, some people are flat-out lying. But when I say ""I KNOW you're lying about your dog being able to climb trees"" or whatever, I'm essentially saying (since I don't personally know you or your dog) that NO dogs can climb trees; it just could not have happened. 

And stupid, non-critical-thinking people are actually living in a world where people have strokes sometimes, out of the blue, after drinking a glass of water or going to church...or getting a vaccine. So it feels like it would be helpful to allow them to SAY that, and ASK their questions, and provide some context &amp; demonstrate how to search for baseline rates of things like that.

"OK, but even THAT, is kind of a kooky line to draw. 

""If they can substantiate"" what? That they had a stroke? I agree with CrazyKitty, most folks will not post their medical records, nor should they be expected to. So that seems like a really high standard, set (deliberately?) to just keep folks from sharing personal anecdotes. But let's say that I post (or DM you) my records, and I prove to you that I had a stroke 2 days after the vaccine...

...And then you ask me ""ARE YOU SAYING that it was from the shot?"" I mean, with or without the records, why would it make a difference what I SAY about causation? (Would you allow the post to stand, if I add ""...but I'm sure it wasn't due to the shot""?)  Look, there's either data, or there isn't, to show that the shot causes strokes or cancer or whatever. Even if I think my myocarditis was NOT caused by the shot (if I were a 17-yr-old boy), there's pretty good evidence that some shots DO cause that. (This would be as silly as a lung cancer patient who doesn't WANT to blame his smoking history for the disease).

I was thinking you could just have a rule: NO personal anecdotes. (Antivaxxers would still accuse you of censoring their truth, but they're gonna do that regardless, so...🙄). But then you would have to totally block/delete posts like this one, which are asking people how they're doing. (AND you would have to delete comments that say ""I got the vaccine, and I'm FINE."") With your current standard, the OP is asking ""how is everyone doing?"" ...but we can all see that there's only one acceptable answer to that question, hmm?

I do think there's a lot of pro-vaxx silliness that doesn't get examined critically, like the ""it-would-have-been-much-worse-without-the-vax"" type claims, and the idea that sore arms and side effects mean that you've got ""better"" immunity. (I saw someone on one of these boards fretting about their LACK of vaccine side effects, as possible evidence of an immunodeficiency😨) So it seems like a double standard, that pro-vaxxers can post silly things, and we can examine it critically &amp; talk them down. But anti-vaxxers are just shushed and deleted 🤷

"I saw this post earlier today. And it's a question I hear often about vaccines, so I wanted to address it.

https://preview.redd.it/ki74r9j459ra1.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e6c10443735d4716e3cde98250ba3b79654d159

The reason we use a no-fault compensation system is because the standard legal process lead to bad outcomes for everyone (including plaintiffs).

US courts are not reliable adjudicators of medical claims--judges and lawyers aren't doctors--so what would happen is the large majority of people suing would lose their case, after years of expensive legal struggles, and the people who won did so more by luck and legal opinion than by having a more valid medical claim than other plaintiffs.

Likewise: vaccines also aren't a huge profit center for pharma (vs other drugs) so many companies pulled out of the market rather than deal with the randomness. This literally lead to vaccine shortages in the 80s. So not only were very few people compensated under this system, but also people who wanted to get vaccinated could not.

The no-fault system was a policy solution that made it easier for individuals claiming to be vaccine injured to get compensation, by lowering the standard of evidence necessary. And to be clear: *you can sue the pharmaceutical company* *if you lose your case here.* It's just that most people who go through this system don't.

It's not perfect but it's better than the alternative.

"I also heard this talking point many times about the Covid vaccines, not understanding the background of the situation. Especially because they really aren't a comparatively profitable area of pharma development. How much money can a manufacturer make when it basically just sells a handful of doses per person for like $20 or less? It's like you ask a company to make a couple 12=pack of socks for everyone in the country, would we think it's the most profitable business venture man have ever conceived of (not to mention that, unlike making socks, vaccines need billions of dollars in research, and there is risk that a new vaccine wouldn't even work, since many vaccines trialed don't work out)?",2023-04-03T15:13:24.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2023-04-03T15:13:24.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2023-04-03T15:13:24.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

"I think you didn't look at your link. It says, ""No new safety signals have been identified in Canada."" And the reporting percentage is 0.056% of all doses administered, and also most of the reports are not serious. 

Also note that you need more data than just these raw data unverified reports. People have various health issues all the time (this is called a ""background rate""), and if you administer nearly 100 million doses of vaccine to Canadians, by chance some will have their unrelated health issues appear close in time to the vaccine. You will have these many coincidences if you give Canadians 100 million doses of saline, or just have them drink glasses of water, or just ask them to think of the color blue for 1 second. There will be hundreds of deaths of Canadians, or heart attacks, or other health problems, within a week of when you asked so many people to think of the color blue or drink that glass of water. Because of statistical coincidence with the background rate, not because of the glass of water.

To understand if it's a vaccine injury there are other data sources that they can be correlated against, such as doctors reports and health insurance claims, then they will check if the type of health condition itself is increasing over its background rate.

"Thank you for posting this, very nice interview with a lot of good topics covered! 

I respect Dr. Offit though in my limited understanding, he is more conservative when it comes to booster than others on the FDA advisory committee. Ironically I wonder if a message that we are supposed to focus boosters only on at-risk people is one of the things that prevents widespread booster takeup in the US population, whether among at risk people or anyone. Because then people will second-guess whether the see themselves as the kind of person that should get a booster. 74% of adults are overweight in the country, which is a risk factor for Covid -- I mean, we're not as healthy a population as we could be. 

The other thing is that even supposedly not at risk populations have such high levels of Covid, that if the vaccination data shows a benefit, then the population should probably be vaccinated and boosted, no? Like children, supposedly not at risk, by conventional wisdom, right? Yet Covid is a leading cause of death. If the risk benefit is in favor of vaccination and boosting, I don't know why that would not be recommended. (Well, actually the CDC does recommend it.) 

Well, anyway, I do appreciate the lucid explanations and also the discussions curbing a lot of the misinformation going around (vaccines and allergies, etc.). Good content.

Hopefully a shift to an annual booster will be an easier campaign to convince people to keep up, as long as Covid hasn't gone away, and the data on risk to benefit ratio supports it. I think that's what the recent Jan 26 FDA committee meeting was discussing (and since the vote was unanimous I would assume that Dr. Offit was in agreement?).

"To be fair, antivaxxers were going strong before Wakefield came on the scene. He ""paved"" a path that was already well worn. I think he's being given too much credit, for an idea that many people can (and have) come up with independently.

Pre-Wakefield, the reigning focus of hysteria was thimerosal, which has been used since the 1930s. Post-Wakefield, we've already moved on to worrying about aluminum. 

And back in the 1700s, people were concerned that the smallpox vaccine derived from cows, would [cause people to turn into cows, or grow bovine body parts](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-50713991) (similar to the fear that mRNA vaccines will mongrelize our genomes), or that people would become unnaturally attracted to cows (again with the fertility issues, and the proprietary focus on fidelity &amp; chastity among our womenfolk).

Wakefield definitely triggered a lot of close scrutiny of MMR in particular, and he firmly implanted the idea of ""too much at once,"" which has caused parents to delay and spread out the vaccine schedule. BUT, when large studies specifically refuted the MMR/autism link, the antivaxxers are quick to pivot to: ""...But you haven't proven that ALL vaccines/ other vaccines /some-synergistic-combination-of-vaccines ---doesn't cause autism!"" 

So the impulse to grasp at some pseudoscience is still there, with or without Wakefield. Stupid gonna stupid.",2023-03-04T15:37:13.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2023-03-04T15:37:13.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_measles,2023-03-04T15:37:13.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_measles

" No. Not \*all\* vaccines, because saline isn't always the best way to test safety or efficacy. 

Safety testing in vaccines is first done on animal analogs. They they go through three phases of trials. 

In phase 1, small groups are tried at different doses and any effects are logged. These can be tested against a saline placebo, or a prepared shot with just the adjuvant used in the vaccine with no antigen. The scientists decide which method will give the best data.

In phase 2, they use larger groups of people, and monitor for efficacy. Again they try different doses, and continue to track any effects as well as how well it works.

In phase 3, they test the most promising dose in large groups (thousands of people) and monitor for rare effects.

You might note that I said any effects, and not any effects caused by what is being tested. By law, any effect is logged, regardless of cause. If someone caught a cold during testing, then runny nose, sore throat and cough get recorded.

Another thing I don’t understand is that the risks of Covid are generally given as outcome per capita cases (usually 100,000) because the studies are simply pulling data from hospitals or health care networks. The important number is going to be the outcome per capita infections, not cases. The outcomes per capita infections will always be lower than cases because not all infections are counted while all cases are. It’s like comparing case fatality rate vs infection fatality rate, ifr will always be lower than cfr",2023-05-16T23:58:10.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2023-05-16T23:58:10.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2023-05-16T23:58:10.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

"That is quite the false assumption you made right there. Injection is very different than ingestion and inhalation. Anything ingested is subject to the gastrointestinal tract before it is absorbed into the bloodstream and ends up in other vital organs and tissues. Up to 99.9% of aluminum is not absorbed when ingested, and is eliminated/removed from the body before it ever reaches the bloodstream. The contents of an injected vaccine are not subject to the gastrointestinal tract. Aluminum, along with other ingredients, are injected intramuscularly in order to intentionally bypass the natural barriers of the body. 

The safety of injected aluminum can only be proven by experiments with injected aluminum. You can’t make a safety assumption based on other methodologies unrelated to the pathways of injection. It’s absurd.

"How much is sold and how much is made has nothing to do with the efficacy of the items in question. The vaccines helps bolster your immune system against these viruses via the spiked protein at the end of the protein chain, supplements can not do that. The supplements are a different story.

"If you've already been infected by a strain of the virus, your body has developed antibodies to that strain. The vaccine isn't necessary, however, if they predict the strain that will be dominant in a given season and it turns out not to be the strain you had, you could get infected with that slightly different strain. It's really your decision. It's 50/50 either way. Since your body already has antibodies for your current variant (whatever it may be) it still gives you a fighting chance against other variants. If you wish to get the vaccine due to precautionary measures, I would say it's a good idea. You never know, if they get the dominant strain right, you'll have a lot easier time fighting it when you do catch it. If they get it wrong, at least you'll have developed antibodies to two strains which should aid in fighting whatever different strain you get infected with.  


Edit: As for the part of the question about infertility, to my knowledge, there doesn't seem to be a link there, despite some antivax people stating otherwise. It's a good question to ask though.

They recognize the virus and they make sure to kill it faster the next time you get it, if you get it again. Basically if you fight off a virus you have immunity against it for up to 20 years.

A vaccine safety monitoring system in late November picked up a signal that the updated Pfizer coronavirus vaccine booster was possibly linked to an increased risk of strokes in people 65 and older. But a deep dive into several large databases failed to confirm the preliminary information, leading federal health officials to conclude the risk is extremely low — and probably nonexistent, those officials said Friday.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose system detected the early signal, and the Food and Drug Administration, which also assesses vaccine safety, have decided there is no need to change the recommendation that everyone 6 months and older should stay up to date with their coronavirus vaccinations, including those 5 and older who are eligible for the updated booster, according to officials speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the agencies.

The early signal involved the bivalent booster — which targets the original virus and omicron subvariants and became available starting in September — made by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech. It did not apply to Moderna’s updated booster, officials said.

Government vaccine safety experts have combed through databases containing millions of records in the United States and consulted with regulators in other countries but have not found any indication that the statistical signal represents a clinical risk to patients. They said they would continue to analyze the data.

Excerpt: 

&gt; Novavax, unlike Pfizer and Moderna, hasn’t yet updated its vaccine to specifically target more recently circulating strains of the virus. “Up through BA.5, our immune responses had held steady,” said Filip Dubovsky, Novavax’s chief medical officer. “I can tell you right now that this XBB, XBB.1, it looks different to us,” he said, referring to a variant family that has raised particular concern in recent weeks.

&gt; Dubovsky said that Novavax has begun making the so-called viral seed needed to begin the manufacturing process for an updated version of its vaccine that would target XBB.1.1.5. That is the subvariant that has recently become dominant across much of the U.S., and raised alarms around the world. Dubovsky said that the company will present data on the XBB family of viruses at a CDC advisory committee hearing later this month.

OK, I'm in the US, but I found [this article](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2023/04/excess-mortality-for-the-third-consecutive-year-in-2022) saying that the excess deaths in the Netherlands were lower in 2022 than they had been in 2020 and 2021. (this is total, for all age groups). It links to [this site](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2023/04/excess-mortality-for-the-third-consecutive-year-in-2022/excess-mortality-and-expected-mortality). Where are you looking, to get the info that excess deaths are rising?

I typically look at OurWorldInData\[dot\]org, where you can see a chart of [total excess deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-mortality-p-scores-projected-baseline?country=~NLD), AND another chart that shows just the [Covid deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?facet=none&amp;Metric=Confirmed+deaths&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Color+by+test+positivity=false&amp;country=~NLD). It looks like you guys had a spike in non-Covid deaths in December, which was already starting to come down by the end of the year. Otherwise, the overall chart looks like those two graphs kind of follow each other: the peaks in all-cause mortality correlate with Covid peaks.

If the December peak was due to the vaccine:

* why did it come down?
* does December correlate with a huge push of more people getting the vaccine?
* Was there maybe a flu outbreak or something else going on in December? (OK I just googled, and it looks like [that was happening](https://dutchreview.com/news/flu-epidemic-netherlands-december-2022/), so that's at least part of an explanation for ya)

But you're still left with the huge peaks in Covid and overall-excess mortality in 2020, way before the vaccine. And like I said, I'm not seeing your evidence that the mortality is going UP from there.

&gt;Also I don't know anybody who took the vaccine and is still saying it's safe and effective or really trust it.

In a free society, it is vital to listen to why people hold the views that they do in hopes of better understanding how to move forward and achieve a society that works for all. Trust in institutions is at a low despite the advancements and achievements of modern medicine and science and understanding why this lack of trust exists is key to expanding the health of American society as a whole.
There are many reasons why some Americans remain skeptical of science and the medical field. One major reason includes the fact that many companies, including pharmaceutical companies, are driven by profit. According to one study, “pharmaceutical companies were viewed with deep distrust” (Jamison et al. 89). This is likely because they are viewed as valuing “profit over the needs of the public” (Jamison et al. 89). It is hard to argue with this fact considering pharmaceutical companies make tons of money through research and selling their products. Afterall, the United States is a capitalist country in which virtually every industry relies on profit to survive.
Another reason for medical skepticism may be the increased usage of social media among the American public. Americans are now more than ever getting their news and information from sites such as Facebook, Tiktok, and Twitter rather than more traditional methods such as television programs and the radio. These websites often fuel misinformation on both sides of the political aisle and may lead people down the track of conspiracies more so than factual, credible information. Although this is true, a bigger reason people fall for misinformation, is a lack of media literacy. As we all know, there is false news, and bad narratives on any form of media. Social media has many benefits for modern medicine, including the fact that “health care leaders” can “directly communicate with the public, sharing information that was traditionally relegated to medical journals and hospital video sessions” (Gottlieb &amp; Dyer 640). This is extremely important, as social media allows science and medicine to be accessible to a larger number of people. However, social media “can” also “allow for virtual celebrities and influencers (both medical and nonmedical) to have a significant influence of information spread due to their number of followers, regardless of the accuracy of their information” (Gottlieb &amp; Dyer 640-641). This is just one example of the harmful effect that social media can have on science and medicine. It highlights how the notion of internet celebrities can have a dire effect on the spread of information and misinformation. People may believe something that Nicki Minaj, for example, has said about the COVID-19 vaccine compared to the words and information spread by scientific agencies such as the CDC.
When exploring medical skepticism, it is important to examine the different groups that coexist in American society and how their trust levels differ. African Americans have many reasons to be skeptical of the American medical field. The United States has a history of discriminating against African Americans and other marginalized groups in virtually every aspect of life, including science and medicine. One study examining levels of trust in the influenza vaccine highlights these differences. According to this study which involved questioning both African Americans and White people regarding their trust in the influenza vaccine, “many African Americans voiced deep-seated distrust of the government’s motives”
(Jamison et al. 91). This can be (at least partially) explained by the history of the United States, including previous harm done to the African American community through things like forced sterilizations. Overall, “for many Whites, trust in government’s role in influenza vaccination is implicit and unquestioned” (Jamison et al. 93). This may be due to the fact that Whites lack the same history of oppression that is prominent for many other marginalized groups, including African Americans. It is important to note that this study was done prior to the COVID epidemic and that the results may differ if Americans were asked the same questions regarding the COVID vaccination.
Furthermore, it is important to explore why medical trust is so important. Trust may play a major role in whether a person seeks professional help for a medical issue. People often turn to alternative medicine when their trust in science and medical institutions is particularly low. It is certainly cause for concern if someone refuses to seek professional medical attention for themselves or their children. One study finds that “more trust in the medical profession” is “associated with following recommendations, relying on the judgment of physicians, seeking professional medical help, and granting increased control and decision making to the physician” (Trachtenberg et al. 348). This implies that trust in the medical field may be associated with taking the advice of medical professionals.

Finally, any discussion of trust in medicine and science should involve ways to move forward. The United States has become increasingly polarized and almost every issue is divided among party lines. This means that even issues that were previously not subject to politicization have become political and this includes science and medicine. This can be evidenced by the willingness of many liberals and the unwillingness of many conservatives to take the COVID-19 vaccination even when their jobs and livelihoods were on the line. However, one study offers promising results regarding partisanship and trust in scientific institutions such as WHO. It “shows that there is a partisan split in average trust in the WHO but that even the Republican and Independent respondents averaged a higher level of trust in the WHO than in their own governors” (Robinson et al. 1117). This means that scientific institutions still hold a level of trust that is higher than political actors. In order to move forward, it is important for scientific and medical institutions to regain their authority and dominance over scientific and medical issues and to lessen their association with politics. Likewise, these organizations should do what they can to rebuild trust with marginalized groups and the general public. There is still certainly work and research to be done to assess what the scientific and medical fields can do in order to rebuild their trust with the American public, however, examining why some people lack trust in these vital institutions is one step towards progress.",2022-12-28T05:29:22.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2022-12-28T05:29:22.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2022-12-28T05:29:22.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid
"The loss of trust and confidence came due to their being victims of misinformation. It's one of the scourges of social media. And how do you know I haven't bothered to talk to them? I'm very in tune to the problem of antivax misinformation, their talking points and methods.

"I’m a mom who vaccinated my children with every required vaccine and am vaccinated myself with nearly everything. I always got a flu shot too. Now I’m not sure that I wouldn’t be an anti-vaxxer if I had a baby today, and it’s not because I’m a follower of mommy blogs or Facebook mommy pages. I’m not. I know one person who is an anti-vaxxer, and I used to think she was nuts. 

What made me skeptical was not misinformation from the anti-vax camp, it was misinformation from government authorities about the covid vaccine. I remember when they claimed loudly that the vaccine was 95% effective. They said that if you got the vaccine you wouldn’t get covid. They said you had to get the vaccine to protect others. Who am I protecting by getting vaccinated when I’m still getting sick and still spreading the disease? A company I work with had their highest number of sick-time call outs ever the month after they fired their unvaccinated employees. How did firing anybody help? Why is it that we’ve seen huge waves of covid AFTER the vaccine rollout? Shouldn’t covid be going away? Shouldn’t there be some sort of drop off in case numbers? 

In my large social circle, I know one person who has not had covid. Everyone has had covid and they’re nearly all vaccinated and boosted. I don’t know a single person who had a serious case. It doesn’t matter if they are vaccinated or not, it’s the same for everyone. The commenter above is correct - it’s an issue of a loss of trust. If they botched the covid vaccine so badly, what else did they botch? The way forward is for the government authorities to show a little humility and admit that the vaccine isn’t nearly as effective as promised. But instead, they double-down on their messaging. I’ve lost all trust in these people and I know many others have too.",2023-01-18T14:27:02.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid,2023-01-18T14:27:02.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid,2023-01-18T14:27:02.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid

Non of my doctors recommended anymore vaccines for me because they cause issues with my health problems.

It’s with kids so it’s understandable.. 
just wondering has anyone with a history of having vaccine injuries gotten subsequent vaccines at a hospital? 
So when the pain comes they can help you control it? Or in cause of an allergic type reaction? 
I’ve considered just taking Advil and Charcoal and praying nothing bad happens?

They call it the suicide disease for a reason. Trigeminal and Neuralgia is the most painful disease known to mankind is more painful than it true terminal cancer and birth.

"&gt;Do you realize these vaccines only provide protection for a few short months right? so unfortunately the protection only last as long as the vaccine does.

""Do you realize these vaccines only provide protection for a few short months right? so unfortunately the protection only last as long as the vaccine does.""

No, there is waning efficacy, but it's not like its a 100% to 0% in a few short months. You are still training your body to deal with COVID, even on a small level.

This may still be two separate things.

There's a Latin phrase ""post hoc ergo propter hoc"" which means ""after this, therefore because of this."" It describes a potential logical fallacy, generally referred to by the shorter phrase, ""post hoc."" Examples: ""Every time that rooster crows, the sun comes up. That rooster must be very powerful and important!""

There is a possibility this was wholly unconnected to the vaccination. As I said, the papers published on the 2 cases that have been studied have not shown any direct causation. From your link above about Trigeminal Neuralgia: ""It is reported that 150,000 people are diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia every year. While the disorder can occur at any age, it is most common in people over the age of 50."" This occured long before any COVID vaccines were available.

Note how the doctors didn't say they would help you be exempt first, they would admit you for pain management if at all possible as a first resort. That is because they still think vaccination is the best move right now.

It's small but this kind of bothered me, hoping it was just a misspeak:""had a full on brain surgery and years of natural treatments""Just a note...

It's only just going to be two years of the vaccine having been available, I feel years might be an exxageration, especially as it usually takes some time to be referred to and have brain surgery when its not an ER situation. Also, what does ""natural treatments"" mean? Was that was was prescribed, or something you searched out yourself? (I have a feeling I know the answer, but I have to ask)

I mean, couldn't it having lasted a year in part because natural treatments by and large don't work, or could have even exacerbated the issues if it was not deemed necessary by a medical professional? I'm honestly curious is all. There are real medications available for this condition: https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/trigeminal-neuralgia

I'm also not downplaying the severity of this condition, as you seem to be implying above. This really really sucks and I'm sorry you went through it.

"Just to clear icy because you are very confused. 

I AM NOT CLAIMING THE VACCINES CAUSED MY TN. My TN was caused by inflammation from Lyme. With Brian surgery and lyme treatments I’ve just gotten my life back after years of being house ridden. 

I ALREADY had it for years and had surgery to fix it PRIOR to getting vaccinated originally. And had been mostly pain free until I received the vaccine and had an attack within a few hours. 

My doctors confirmed it was 100% connected as the attack was within two hours and I previously had surgery to prevent the pain and had been pain feee for awhile before the attack. 
IN PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING Trigeminal Neuralgia they almost always flare from these vaccines. This is constantly happening to their patients unfortunately. 
I took meds for five years for TN. I did natural treatments for Lyme disease and a few other blood born infections with amazing results and because my inflammation went down so did remaining symptoms. 
But when I get sick or my immune system is altered in any way I will have an attack. 

You cannot take meds for that unless it’s IV meds because most anti convulsants build up in the system over many weeks and won’t work in an acute attack. 
You need to be hospitalized for pain control in those situations. 

Also. It’s not your job to determine if a vaccine caused injury or damage. That’s what my doctors are for.

i (F22) got the hpv vaccine (Gardasil 9) last thursday (15th) and on friday i started to get what i assume is an allergic reaction in the form of hives. i ended up going to the night doctor and he prescribed Histaclar for seven days. i rang the centre that gave me the vaccine and they told me to contact my normal doctor (im a student living away from home). i rang my normal doctor and they told me to get in contact with the centre that vaccinated me as they would know what to do with regards to reactions like this…i was kind of led around in circles. i went to the pharmacy and got hydrocortisone cream to help the itching and flare ups and some other antihistamines. i have both individual hives but big patches the size of my hand. one patch that was below my bellybutton and one the was on the front of my thigh have healed. however this morning i woke up with two patches extending from my inner thigh all the way down the back of my leg. im doing my absolute best to not itch them at all.

i’ve researched if any other people or test groups have had effects like this but i can’t find anything about it. i’m glad i got the vaccine as my dad did not want me to get it in school (schools where i am provide free hpv vaccinations).

A person's choice to decline vaccinations does not outweigh public health and safety requirements in medical settings, a federal judge ruled in a Montana case.

U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy last week permanently blocked a section of law the state said was meant to prevent employers — including many health care facilities — from discriminating against workers by requiring them to be vaccinated against communicable diseases, including COVID-19.

“The public interest in protecting the general populace against vaccine-preventable diseases in health care settings using safe, effective vaccines is not outweighed by the hardships experienced to accomplish that interest,” Molloy concluded in his Dec. 9 ruling.

He describes the studies in these threads. 

Regarding the original OP question. There is no studies assessing real world efficacy in preventing the infection. This is expected to be low and short-lived. On the order of 50% for a few months. 

The reasons for that are varied. There is certainly some immune imprinting where the body preferentially generates antibodies against the original vaccine antigen. There is immune escape by newest mutated variants. There is the issue that current vaccines generate very little mucosal immunity for a virus that nowadays creates upper respiratory track infections. 

The efficacy against severe disease is however much higher 4-6 times compared to no vaccine. There is a clear benefit for older people to take a booster.",2022-10-26T20:33:10.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2022-10-26T20:33:10.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown,2022-10-26T20:33:10.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

A frail 90 year old man, might be another thing, despite there are many cases of people at that age who survived original COVID without major issues. It's hard to say.

My take is that healthy people do not need to take precautions anymore whereas frail persons need to exercise care to the extend it doesn't interfere with other aspects of their lives, particularly mental health. 

For that reason, I fully understand that many care homes are dropping masks. It is often difficult to communicate with the elderly in a normal setting, it becomes harder through masks.

"I took a look at the report but I did not see any references to the contributing factors that I mentioned. I spent 5 years at Oregon Health Sciences University in the 80s working on the administrative side of medical research (reviewing dozens of protocols and progress reports) and my time there left me somewhat jaded about the processes involved. I can't imagine that profits drive research any less today than it did then. There was a multi-year study of single bypass heart surgery, which was the single most profitable medical procedure at the time. I left there before the end of the study but the results I had access to over a significant number of years showed that post-surgery there was NO improvement in the morbidity rates of patients compared to non-surgical treatment, and the net result of deaths including in the process of surgery made the procedure a net negative.

This is a pretty underwhelming conspiracy reveal. They even ramped down the procedure, by your account. Why would you expect that routine comparison and modifying best practices in a certain type of surgery would make a huge media splash? And you said that you left before the end of the study which means you didn't even have the final data -- so maybe the later statistics on the procedure got better and closer to being a net positive. Medical procedures are researched and sometimes it's a gray area because the default is to want to do something, whereas it might turn out that doing something can be a net negative (it's why cancer screenings without other symptoms don't always make sense, you end up overly treating small things that might not turn into cancer -- for example they no longer push for prostate cancer screening to everyone). It's good that they follow up and compare to either doing nothing or using other techniques.

"You had documented COVID three months ago, and you were re-exposed recently? But you felt fine when you got the shot?  
Should be no problem. I guess the pitfalls would be:  


* Your immunity was recently ""boosted"" by the actual virus, so the benefit of the vaccine may be minimal. There are studies showing that infection-plus-vaccine immunity is superior to infection-alone, but I don't think that's been well-stratified for the duration of time since either/ both of those events. Like (MADE-UP NUMBERS HERE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;) if your immunity was ""100%"" right after you had the illness, and it falls to 50% by six months, then you would get more benefit by being vaccinated at six months, than at 3 weeks post-infection, right? Because, as soon as you get the vaccine, it also starts to wane, so maybe you should wait longer before vaccination, to get the maximum benefit? BUT, in gaming that system, you risk re-infection the longer you wait, as your naturally-acquired immunity is waning too.
* Your recently-boosted immunity causes a strong reaction to the vaccine &gt;&gt; more side effects. I wouldn't expect this with the mRNA shot, since the shot doesn't contain actual spike proteins or viral particles (to which your body has been recently sensitized). Most people have their vaccine side effects within the first 24 hours, so I figure that's just nonspecific inflammation in response to the adjuvant. The mRNA and the vaccine-produced spike protein are likely in your system for several days, but most people's side effects resolve before then, so I'm thinking there may not be a lot of correlation there, that would be affected by a recent infection.

So I think the bottom line is, don't overthink it. There's no data on how soon is ""too soon"" or whether it does either of those things, and we've been shooting at moving targets for the past 2 years. But the time your immunity from this shot wanes, we'll be three variants down the road.

If you think about it, why don't they give the two Pfizer shots one week apart? Or six month apart? Who's to say whether that might work better, or cause more (or fewer) side effects? I mean, they picked a dose and an interval, and proved that it worked better than not doing anything. And in [that initial trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577), only 10% of the participants had had a prior infection... and those would've probably been pretty recent, right?",2022-10-10T21:04:57.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2022-10-10T21:04:57.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2022-10-10T21:04:57.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

"Regarding flu shots, you *do* actually get multiple flu shots when you get the flu vaccine. In the US, all flu vaccines are now quadrivalent, meaning that they contain four different vaccines in one dose. Two for Influenza A and two for Influenza B. It used to be trivalent, with two vaccines for A and one for B, but the CDC felt that an extra B vaccine would help protect people better because there are usually two strains of B that make the rounds during flu season.

&gt; Why have some diseases required an increased number of vaccines than they used to?

It would be helpful if you could name some of these diseases. Otherwise it's basically FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) based on no evidence.

I think what you may be trying to ask is why do some diseases now have more vaccine *doses* required than they used to. The answer to that question is that if research has shown that a different vaccine schedule works better at maintaining protective antibodies, then that schedule will replace a previous one that provides less protection. Please note that this isn't the same as requiring an ""increased number of vaccines"" if the vaccine is the same but just administered on a different schedule than it used to be.",2022-10-16T23:19:14.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_influenza,2022-10-16T23:19:14.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_influenza,2022-10-16T23:19:14.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_influenza

"Several reasons:  
  
1. Because we can. In the case of Rotavirus, it took a while to develop a safe effective vaccine. As soon as it was available, the CDC recommended it. So presumably, if that vaccine had been available 20 years earlier, we would have been using it then.  
  
2. Because, for some diseases, additional boosters have been found to reduce that tiny-remaining-percentage of disease, even further. Thus when we had measles outbreaks among college students in the 1980s, the booster(second dose) was added to the schedule. And adult pertussis boosters were added to decrease the number of adults who are carrying pertussis asymptomatically, so that they don't pass it along to babies who haven't gotten their shots yet. I don't think this is an example of how vaccines ""don't work;"" rather, it's an example of increasing from 97% effectiveness, to more like 99.5% effectiveness.  
  
3. Because we have decreased tolerance for smaller numbers of infant deaths. Chickenpox, for example, had a vaccine available in the 1970s, but wasn't recommended for all kids (in the US) until the 1990s. (It still isn't routinely used in the UK). Weirdly, I think that back when infant &amp; child mortality were much higher from pertussis, it made chickenpox seem mild by comparison. But with smallpox, diphtheria and polio pretty much wiped out in first-world countries, the very few deaths from these other, ""smaller"" diseases seemed to be unacceptable.  
  
4. Because we know more about the life cycle of some illness...like the fact that HPV can cause cancer.  
  
5. Polio, specifically, went from oral to injected in the late 90s (in the US) because the oral polio had about a 1-in-1-million chance of giving vaccine-derived disease.  
  
6. And finally, for some diseases, there are actually FEWER doses given today. Like smallpox, which was eradicated, so we stopped vaccinating for it in the 1970s, I think. And polio used to be 5 doses in the US; now it's 4 (although they did switch from oral to injected, so it's more ""shots"" even though it's fewer doses). And of course, with the combination shots, it's fewer shots to get vaccinated for more things.  
  
But just a caveat: if your vax-skeptical family members are wanting to spread out the doses, they are signing up for more appointments, more shots, more screaming and febrile reactions....basically conditioning their child to be fearful of doctor visits....because Wakefield told them it was safer that way. 🤷",2022-10-21T14:40:06.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2022-10-21T14:40:06.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown,2022-10-21T14:40:06.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_unknown

*Maternal vaccination with two doses of mRNA vaccine was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization for Covid-19, including for critical illness, among infants younger than 6 months of age.*",2022-06-25T12:08:55.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2022-06-25T12:08:55.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2022-06-25T12:08:55.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid
"*In summary, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have the potential to trigger de novo ITP (including clinically undiagnosed cases), albeit very rarely. Distinguishing vaccine‐induced ITP from coincidental ITP presenting soon after vaccination is impossible at this time. Additional surveillance is needed to determine the true incidence of thrombocytopenia post vaccination.*",2022-06-25T04:52:41.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown,2022-06-25T04:52:41.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown,2022-06-25T04:52:41.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

"Impact of population mixing between vaccinated and unvaccinated subpopulations on infectious disease dynamics: implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission


Results: We found that the risk of infection was markedly higher among unvaccinated people than among vaccinated people under all mixing assumptions. The contact-adjusted contribution of unvaccinated people to infection risk was disproportionate, with unvaccinated people contributing to infections among those who were vaccinated at a rate higher than would have been expected based on contact numbers alone. We found that as like-with-like mixing increased, attack rates among vaccinated people decreased from 15% to 10% (and increased from 62% to 79% among unvaccinated people), but the contact-adjusted contribution to risk among vaccinated people derived from contact with unvaccinated people increased.",2022-04-25T10:09:23.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2022-04-25T10:09:23.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown,2022-04-25T10:09:23.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

"ABSTRACT

&amp;#x200B;

Israel began administering a BNT162b2 booster dose to restore protection  
 following the waning of the 2-dose vaccine. Biological studies have   
shown that a “fresh” booster dose leads to increased antibody levels   
compared to a fresh 2-dose vaccine, which may suggest increased   
effectiveness. To compare the real-world effectiveness of a fresh (up to  
 60 days) booster dose with that of a fresh 2-dose vaccine, we took   
advantage of a quasi-experimental study that compares populations that   
were eligible to receive the vaccine at different times due to   
age-dependent policies. Specifically, we compared the confirmed   
infection rates in adolescents aged 12–14 (215,653 individuals) who   
received the 2-dose vaccine and in adolescents aged 16–18 (103,454   
individuals) who received the booster dose. Our analysis shows that the   
confirmed infection rate was lower by a factor of 3.7 (95% CI: 2.7 to   
5.2) in the booster group.",2022-04-21T07:41:37.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2022-04-21T07:41:37.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown,2022-04-21T07:41:37.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid

"*Discussion*

*Our findings indicate that vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron variant is substantially lower than with the delta variant. After two doses, vaccine effectiveness waned rapidly, with very limited vaccine effects seen from 20 weeks after the second dose of any vaccine. Booster doses resulted in a substantial increase in protection against mild infection; however, waning of protection against symptomatic disease was also seen after booster doses.*

&gt; CAMBRIDGE, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 23, 2022 / Moderna, Inc., a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA therapeutics and vaccines, today announced positive interim data from the Phase 2/3 KidCOVE study of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in children 6 months to under 2 years and 2 years to under 6 years of age.

&gt; SARS-Cov-2-neutralizing antibody geometric mean ratio comparing the response in children 6 months to under 2 years to the response in young adults from the Phase 3 COVE study was 1.3 and was 1.0 for the 2 to under 6 years age group.

&gt; Using the Phase 3 COVE study COVID-19 definition, vaccine efficacy in children 6 months to 2 years was 43.7% and vaccine efficacy was 37.5% in the 2 to under 6 years age group.

Zambrano et al. found a 91% protective effect of complete (2 doses) BNT162b2 vaccination against MIS-C (8).

This shows even more effect of masking than the recently published [CDC study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7110e1.htm?s_cid=mm7110e1_e) on school districts in Arkansas. I think this NIH study probably shows a larger effect because it distinguishes school-acquired infections from community acquired infections (hence the greater effect of masking). The CDC study showed less effect from masking at school because of course many -- or most -- infections occur outside the school (so how could masking at school have an effect on that?).,2022-03-11T16:33:52.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2022-03-11T16:33:52.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2022-03-11T16:33:52.000Z,no_vcc,na,na

&gt; Reported more deaths from COVID-19 last Friday than deaths from Hurricane Katrina, more on any two recent weekdays than deaths during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, more last month than deaths from flu in a bad season, and more in two years than deaths from HIV during the four decades of the AIDS epidemic.

&gt; Working-class people were five times more likely to die from COVID than college graduates in 2020, and in California, essential workers continued dying at disproportionately high rates even after vaccines became widely available.

&gt; Rew Noymer, the demographer, thinks that COVID will kill fewer people per year than it has in the past two, but will probably still be more lethal than the flu, which sets a plausible and very wide range of somewhere between 50,000 and 500,000 annual deaths.

"There was a definitive study of boosting using the same or different combination of the 3 vaccines approved in the US, [published here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2116414). So if we call the vaccines P (Pfizer), M (Moderna) and J (J&amp;J), they had groups of people who had initially had P, M, or J take a booster of P, M, or J (so 9 combinations, P-&gt;P, P-&gt;M, P-&gt;J, and so on). The only combination that didn't have very good results for antibody production was J-&gt;J, the results were a little underwhelming. Even though J works well as a booster for an initial course of P or M.


The speculation is that the J&amp;J adenovirus vector could be stimulating an immune response, so the next time you get the same vaccine your body fights the vaccine and attenuates its effectiveness. By the way, even though the Sputnik V vaccine is a similar technology, the vaccine makers thought of this and used two different adenoviruses for doses 1 and 2. Astrazeneca didn't do this.

Moderna followed by Pfizer was a perfectly good combination.",2022-03-11T15:52:13.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_unknown,2022-03-11T15:52:13.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2022-03-11T15:52:13.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid

From the study itself:

"&gt; **Will vaccines protect against emerging variants?**

&gt; The 54 mutations in Omicron’s genome — and particularly the 34 clustered in a key viral protein called spike — severely weakens the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. **But protection against severe disease seems to have remained high, and probably contributed to the perceived mild disease caused by Omicron.**",2022-03-01T00:16:11.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2022-03-01T00:16:11.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2022-03-01T00:16:11.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid
"*This article is a preprint and has not been certified by peer review*

*Participants: 7,925 participants of the Omtanke2020 study with complete data on depressive and anxiety symptoms and vaccination status.*

*Results: 5,079 (64.1%) individuals received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, 1,977 (24.9%) received one dose, 305 (3.9%) were not vaccinated, and 564 (7.1%) chose not to report vaccination status.

"Indeed.

*But some types of exposure might be better than others for preparing the body to fight off new variants. One study3,which has not yet been peer reviewed, found that people who had been vaccinated and then were infected with Omicron experienced “whoppingincreases in antibodies”, says virologist Penny Moore at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. Those antibodies could attach to and disarm multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants besides Omicron,a property called cross-reactivity.*

&amp;#x200B;

*But antibodies produced by people who have been infected with Omicron but not previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 — either by vaccination or infection — were not as robust in blocking other variants. “We can’t assume that those people would be particularly well protected against incoming variants of concern,” Moore says.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Ultimately, the data continue to point to the importance of vaccination,says Burgers. “We know that vaccines shore up our immunity and that immunity will be cross-reactive, when it comes to T cells, with another variant,” she says. “There’s a lot that we don’t know, but there’s a lot that’s in our control.”*",2022-03-01T02:19:23.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_tetanus,2022-03-01T02:19:23.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2022-03-01T02:19:23.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid

"This is the Bangladesh reported last year. It was interesting because there was a randomization and control involved, where communities were either encouraged (study group) or not encouraged (control group) to wear masks. Since then I occasionally see references to it pop up almost like a Rorschach test. People either say it proves that masks are effective  -- because there was a demonstrable difference between the ""unmasked"" and ""masked"" communities -- or that masks are nearly ineffective -- because that demonstrable difference was only 11%. However, the 11% is misunderstood by some as meaning the effectiveness of masks. That's not true, since the ""unmasked"" communities were not completely unmasked and the ""masked"" communities were not completely in compliance with masks (not even 50%), nor did people wear masks all day. So it was not a measure of mask effectiveness. It was a measure of the *effectiveness of encouraging people to wear masks using the methods in the study*.",2022-02-28T19:28:52.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2022-02-28T19:28:52.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2022-02-28T19:28:52.000Z,no_vcc,na,na

Hey guys, this probably has been discused already but I'd like to know if either of you have experienced some of the same side effects that I have after the vaccination for the covid 19.

Before I was eligible for the vaccine there were some weird news about the vaccine making grow sizes of the breast on women and after that some about menstrual irregularities too. I could care less about the fertility thread since I don't want children. But I did ask about the breast growth and some people working with doctors told me that they were lies and others that it was just swelling and it'd pass.

I had my first two shots in July and August and I indeed experienced the breast growth and some menstrual delay and less than usual, and I had a third shot in December.

I feel bad because the ""swelling"" is not going away after all these months and I am fu\*\*\*\* 36 years old so I don't thing it is normal to keep growing at this age.

""One of the more uncommon side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine is enlarged lymph nodes, including in the armpit,"" explains Jane Murphy, a senior clinical nurse specialist at UK charity Breast Cancer Now. Lymph nodes – bean-shaped pockets of cells located around the body – can swell in reaction to any vaccine or illness as the immune system fights infection, she says. ""It’s usually a temporary reaction and goes down after a few weeks, but for some people it may be slightly longer."" According to Public Health England (PHE), there is a less than 1% chance of enlarged lymph nodes after vaccination.

""There’s absolutely no link between the vaccine and breast swelling or cancer,"" says Dr Sarah Vinnicombe, chair of the British Society of Breast Radiology (BSBR).

The swelling of lymph nodes post-vaccine has also helped spawn another baseless rumour – that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine increases breast size. Streams of women have claimed their boobs grew after vaccination in what’s become known as the 'Pfizer boob job'. One of the first to make the claim online was a young TikTok user who excitedly alleged that her boobs had grown two cup sizes since the vaccine. The video has been viewed more than 76,900 times, with scores of commenters expressing hope for the rumour to be true and posting fingers-crossed emoji.Some women may have genuinely felt an increase in breast size since being vaccinated but it’s likely due to enlarged lymph nodes, which is temporary, says Murphy. ""It’s not likely to be breast tissue.""

  
And since it's been months, it's highly unlikely, also - why wouldn't you go see a doctor for months if something is wrong? Go see a doctor. Post ergo proctor hoc fallacy - just because something came after, doesn't mean it's because of.

"mRNA vaccines have been developed over decades, and studied quite extensively over the last 20 years, we already had a few successful mRNA vaccines used prior to COVID. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html

mRNA vaccines work by introducing a piece of mRNA that corresponds to a viral protein, usually a small piece of a protein found on the virus’s outer membrane. (Individuals who get an mRNA vaccine are not exposed to the virus, nor can they become infected by the vaccine.) Using this mRNA blueprint, cells produce the viral protein. As part of a normal immune response, the immune system recognizes that the protein is foreign and produces specialized proteins called antibodies. Antibodies help protect the body against infection by recognizing individual viruses or other pathogens, attaching to them, and marking the pathogens for destruction. Once produced, antibodies remain in the body, even after the body has rid itself of the pathogen, so that the immune system can quickly respond if exposed again. If a person is exposed to a virus after receiving mRNA vaccination for it, antibodies can quickly recognize it, attach to it, and mark it for destruction before it can cause serious illness.

mRNA vaccines represent a promising alternative to conventional vaccine approaches because of their high potency, capacity for rapid development and potential for low-cost manufacture and safe administration.

"This is just an aside from the main point of the article, but I always disliked using the word ""rate"" to refer to a fraction of a population. I see doctors and research papers often using it, especially when referring to the ""rate"" of hospitalizations of children from Covid. But the problem is that this kind of ""rate"" convolutes both the severity of the disease and the infectiousness, so you can get confused about what's happening by looking at this one number. Knowing the rate of hospitalization *per infection* and the current case rate or hospitalization rate makes much more sense to understanding and estimating risk to kids. 

So Omicron is both less severe to kids, and more infectious. It's the more infectious part that means the hospitalization ""rate"" has gone up.

Just think of how it makes little sense to refer to ""rate"" when talking about other fractions of populations, despite essentially being the same measure for that thing.

&gt; The vaccinated blood samples, due to their much-elevated RBD antibody levels, were far more effective in neutralizing both the WT and N501Y RBD from binding to ACE. With an average of 16-fold greater potency than convalescent blood, the vaccinated blood samples were more than sufficient to compensate for the fivefold increased affinity of N501Y RBD, resulting in the highly effective inhibition of both the WT and N501Y RBD from binding to ACE2.

"Please no political pov I'm just asking on a scientific side of things since there's alot of info out there... okay now that that's out of the way 

To start this is what I understand on covid deaths and how the vaccine works 
As far as I know 2.5% of people infected die (yes that's a large amount of people cause of how easy it spreads I understand) 
And the vaccine doesn't lower the chance of infectious just lowers the chance of death 

If this isn't true please comment a link explaining how this works 


How ever If that's true then what difference dose it make to people who are vaccinated if others don't have the vaccine ? 

Like on a smaller scale example but let's change the death%to 100% (if not vaccinated) 
And people who are vaccinated survival is 100% to make my question even simpler

Say there's 100 people on a island and 1 person has covid 19 
25/100 are not vaccinated 

Won't the 25 who are not vaccinated just die ? And the rest of the people will just carry on with out issue like if the vaccine is good then people who are not vaccinated are only hurting them selfs ? 
And really makes no difference to the rest of the world ? 

Again no hate please 
I'll be honest enough to say I don't understand how all this works but I'd rather be somone that asks a question that may sound silly then never understand",2022-02-14T10:41:07.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2022-02-14T10:41:07.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2022-02-14T10:41:07.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid
"&gt; As far as I know 2.5% of people infected die

Overall it's down to 1.4%; it was 7% before we knew how to treat it.  

And this is 1.4% of people *who test positive*.  This is the *case* fatality rate.  *Infection* fatality rate is lower and hard to estimate.  https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid#understanding-the-case-fatality-crude-mortality-and-the-infection-fatality-rate

Note that 1.4% is a pretty high number.  The chances of dying if you test positive for COVID are about 4,500 times as high as your chances of dying if you go skydiving once, for instance.  https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/s05llu/im_unvaccinated_and_positive_read_this_before_you/hs4cz41/

&gt; And the vaccine doesn't lower the chance of infectious just lowers the chance of death 

I'm not sure if you meant ""infection"" or ""infectious"":

* Vaccine does *not* prevent infection; it prevents that infection from causing disease
* Vaccine *does* make you less infectious (milder illness = shorter time period to spread it to others)
* Masks and other barriers lower the chance of infection.

&gt; How ever If that's true then what difference dose it make to people who are vaccinated if others don't have the vaccine ? 

Because person A being vaccinated makes person B less likely to get COVID.  Even if person B is vaccinated, it's not a magic shield that makes you invulnerable to the disease.  You can still die or get permanent lung or heart damage or blood clots from COVID, even if you're vaccinated; it just makes it less likely.

So your example of 100% immunity is not realistic

"The main issue is not only death, but surviving as an unvaccinated person. If someone has to be hospitalized for covid, that is very severe regardless of vaccination status. The vaccine works to decrease the chance that it progresses that far. It happens that people survive, a lot, but with such a reduced quality of life. For instance, lungs, heart, brain damaged, being on oxygen for the rest of one's life, unable to do daily living tasks without assistance, like cooking, bathing, dressing, walking on their own.

How does it impact everyone else? For every severely sick person of covid, society could lose: a worker, a taxpayer, a caregiver, and more. Not to mention the impeded ability of someone to take care of themselves, so they may need their own caregiver, burn out family trying to help them, and lose the ability to make an income.

I'm not gonna lie, it doesn't happen this severe to every person every time, and anyone can definitely get covid more than once, vaccinated or not, but the severity when someone is vaccinated, on average, tends to be much less.

These kinds of issues, on a large scale, impact the economy, impact the job market, impact in a HUGE way healthcare spending and quality of services, for example.

"It does work to reduce spread. 100% less likely to get an spread covid when vaccinated. Sure, thats not 100%, and effectiveness against each strain differes, but there is a marked difference.

Also, preexisting conditions and even possibly genetics matter. You can be a perfectly healthy, fit and active adult and get knocked sideways or hospitalized with COVID.

If only the unvaccinated by choice were going to die, pretty sure we wouldnt be dealing with mandates and wed just let darwin settle it.

Also, unchecksd spread in unvaccinated populations cause spees up variant production.

https://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/info-2020/covid-vaccine-myths.html

Also, youd be suggesting that most of the world accept the deaths of 2-5 out of 100 people if we are just fine without vaccinations, which put undue strains on our hospitals, workforce, etc.

If the people choosing not to vaccinate didnt go to hospitals and just died in their homes, wed probably have less issue with it.

When it comes down to it, this isnt just a health issue, its national security and economics.

You definitely need to start with some basic primers on what vaccinations are, why we take them in general before diving into the more nitty gritty of COVID.",2022-02-14T13:02:26.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid,2022-02-14T13:02:26.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2022-02-14T13:02:26.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid

"I noticed that the description of this subreddit says that we're dedicated to providing factual information and news regarding vaccines. This gave me an idea. When you're arguing with someone who's nervous about vaccines, it helps to be able to provide concrete data. So here's what I'm thinking: Working together, we compile a research document *(probably a google doc that's publicly shared)* that features dozens of links to sources that confirm the safety and effectiveness of vaccines - links to studies and experiments that have been peer-reviewed and fact-checked, articles published in scholarly journals, statistics regarding how effective vaccines are, as well as counterarguments to anti-vax talking points. This way, when you're arguing with someone or trying to convince them, you can immediately cite concrete evidence. I was thinking that the document could be organized into the following sections: An introduction on what vaccines are and how they work, a section providing a list of peer reviewed, fact checked studies and experiments conducted by scientists and doctors proving the effectiveness of vaccines, a section on the statistics and numbers we see when vaccines are used for real in a population *(numbers and rates of vaccinations, number of disease cases prior to mass vaccination vs post mass-vaccination, percentage of vaccinated people who experience side effects and breakthrough infections vs percentage that don't, how the severity of breakthrough infections &amp; side effects compares to the severity of infections in unvaccinated people, etc)* as well as a final section debunking the various arguments used by anti-vaxxers. If we all work together to provide links to this sort of evidence in the comments section under this post, I could compile them into the document, and we could maybe even make a copy of that document into a pinned post in this subreddit. We could also get some help from the members of the subreddit r/VACCINES, and maybe the research document could be available there too. What do you say, sound like something you'd be interested in? If you want to provide links for this, just make sure to exclusively provide links to fact-checked, peer-reviewed data from scholarly, credible sources, so we can't be accused of using anecdotes.",2022-02-10T18:58:59.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2022-02-10T18:58:59.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_unknown,2022-02-10T18:58:59.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_unknown

"**Conclusions**

&amp;#x200B;

*This case emphasizes the need for further research and discussion on the*  
 *effects of COVID-19 on neonates along with more research concerning the*  
 *vertical transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Adequate guidelines for*   
*the management of COVID-19 infection in this population are lacking due*   
*to limited data. The effects of COVID-19 infection on*   
*neonates may also be more severe than current scientific literature*   
*seems to suggest. This case illustrates how significant morbidity and*   
*mortality can result from COVID-19 infection in neonates and can result*   
*in rapid deterioration and demise.* 

***The importance of vaccination***   
***against COVID-19 for pregnant mothers to reduce the risk for***

I tried calling the mass vaccination site where I got it and no one was able to help about the name change on the card. I even checked the state immunization record and I couldn’t find my vaccine record on it.So im thinking about getting fully vaccinated again (Pfizer) just to get it over with and get a card with my new name on it.

"Federal deadlines to vaccinate all health-care workers against COVID-19 are just weeks away, but the most recent federal data show that roughly a fifth of nursing-home employees are not yet fully vaccinated.

The Supreme Court in January upheld the mandate that covers 76,000 health care facilities and their 10.4 million employees. Now medical employers have until late February or mid-March, depending on what state they’re in, to vaccinate their staffers, or risk losing federal Medicare and Medicaid payments.

What percentage of long-term care workers have been vaccinated varies by state, from 99% to 68% as of Jan. 16, according to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 

What does the vaccination rate look like in your state? Check out our story (and a map):

"People have always been extremely resistant to change, and people have always claimed that these types of changes infringe on their freedom.

For example: literally the exact same arguments about personal freedom were used against making seat belt laws, making wearing a seat belt mandatory.

The only thing that is really “different” is that this is new, and almost no one alive now was alive/an adult when the last set of laws or regulations involving vaccines were passed.

So going with the seat belt example, since most of us were children or not even born when those laws were enacted, we grew up with them simply being there. No thought about it needed. No concern about loosing our freedom. In short- no emotional impulse knee-jerk reaction to change of any type, followed by some stupid rationalization to somehow justify our emotional impulse against change. All we have now that the emotions have gone is normal rational thought that lets us know of course, wearing a seatbelt is a good idea. And the years of empirical evidence showing they saves lives.

Here is a list of things I can remember being argued against in my lifetime (and some I studied about historically) because they will somehow take away your freedom or somehow will lead to more government control/ communism/ fascism):
- Any new form of ID, first on paper, then anything digital
- Microchips of any kind
- cable tv
- Cell phones
- and before that, the telephone, which in many places started with party lines
- The internet
- Personal computers
- digitalization of any process whatsoever
- motorcycle helmets
- free trade with foreign nations (anything different than what was status quo at the moment)
- solar energy
- any redrawing of geographic districts , be it city, state, or country
- Health insurance
- specific kinds of health insurance (the rise of HMOs)
- the lack of health insurance
- toll roads
- interstate highways &amp; other roads

So you see, the list can go on and on. Once you study  the propaganda around a few historical events, you cone to realize that humans just fear change.",2022-02-03T20:55:38.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2022-02-03T20:55:38.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown,2022-02-03T20:55:38.000Z,no_vcc,na,na

Nevermind that the idea is not to think of a single scenario where it's bad, but to look at the average over all scenarios -- in other words, look at the statistics.

Even though it's theoretically possible to die trapped in a burning wreck like a caged animal, you should still wear a seatbelt.

"Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective public health   
interventions in infectious disease outbreaks if it is made accessible   
and acceptable to the people (Lahariya, 2016).  
 Recently, many countries have approved some coronavirus disease   
(COVID-19) vaccines and are presently adopting nationwide vaccination   
strategies to protect people from COVID-19 infection (Nature, 2020).  
 However, these promising COVID-19 vaccines may not be accessible,   
acceptable, and affordable to people, especially those in low and   
middle-income countries (LMICs) due to multiple barriers such as a lack   
of adequate resources, safety concerns, and the emergence of an   
anti-vaccine movement (Burki, 2020; Nature, 2020).  
 In this letter, we aim to explore the potential impact of this   
anti-vaccine movement on the COVID-19 vaccination program and mental   
health.

&amp;#x200B;

 The anti-vaccine movement is not a new phenomenon and has occurred in most of the infectious disease outbreaks in past (Hussain et al., 2018).  
 These movements tend to present the vaccine as more harmful than the   
disease itself by linking vaccines with other illnesses (e.g., in 1998,   
the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine was linked with autism) (Smith, 2017).  
 The COVID-19 anti-vaccine movement appears to be fueled by conspiracy   
theories, false beliefs, a lack of confidence among stakeholders, and a   
presumed lack of transparency (e.g, efficacy, and safety) in the vaccine  
 approval process (Zadrozny, 2020).  
 In addition, many people appear to harbor low-risk perceptions of   
COVID-19 infection due to good recovery rates especially among the   
young.

&amp;#x200B;

 The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures such as lockdowns have   
increased the prevalence of mental health issues through the disruption   
of mental health services (Tandon, 2021; Xiong et al., 2020).  
 The anti-vaccine movement may further prolong the duration of the   
COVID-19 pandemic and may increase mortality or morbidity, resulting in   
an exacerbation of health inequalities and flaring the economic and   
social disparities. This may lead to not only an increase in the burden   
of COVID-19 infection but also mental health issues in poorer and   
marginalized people across the different LMICs.

...

&amp;#x200B;

 To conclude, the COVID-19 anti-vaccine movement can affect community   
health, and possibly prolong the COVID-19 pandemic, and will   
inadvertently increase the burden of mental health issues. A systematic   
approach, appropriate innovative interventions, and global-public health  
 initiatives are needed to prevent this.",2022-01-30T03:06:08.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid,2022-01-30T03:06:08.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2022-01-30T03:06:08.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid

*As a result, Fortune asked Ipsos to expand the survey to include four new countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia.*

*\*The findings were remarkably similar across all six countries. Among thegeneral population, there’s wide support for compulsory vaccinationrules.

"So I’m trying to make an informed decision about whether I want to get the covid vaccine and I usually like to listen to podcasts to get my information. 

I like listening to Joe Rogan, and of course I’ve had no difficulty finding guests of his who are anti-vax because of the amount of publicity they get. I’m wondering if anyone knows any reputable scientists he’s had on his show who are pro-vax or maybe just not heavily anti-vax so I can hear out both sides. 

If not Joe Rogan then I’m happy to be referred to other podcasts, but I don’t really want it to be between two pro-vaxers as I want a bit of push back.

"The medical and scientific community is confident in the long-term safety of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for several reasons:

The history of vaccines shows that delayed effects after vaccination can happen. But when they do, these effects tend to happen within six weeks of receiving a vaccine. This is why regulators in many countries require at least eight weeks of safety data before approving a vaccine. The vaccines have now been in use for months, with over 9.5 billion doses given worldwide.

The mRNA vaccines have been in development for many years and have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). In addition, cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells. Decades of studying mRNA vaccines have shown no long-term side effects.",2022-01-27T23:52:36.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2022-01-27T23:52:36.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2022-01-27T23:52:36.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid

look for the Mayo Clinic’s channel, there are plenty of podcasts on the vaccine.

Also the Star Talk channel, Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, has a lot of episodes on the vaccine.

(Added note: this next one I recommend most- single episode- includes Drs that were skeptical at first, and through the actual science, not politics or emotion, have changed their opinion.)
There is also a very good episode with several Drs and Epidemiologists on an unusual crossover type podcast episode. The Mormon Stories channel is an unrelated channel covering social and religious issues, but there is a very good crossover episode where he is interviewing 3 doctors/epidemiologists that also happen to be Mormon, which is how the episode happen to come about.

"**Methods**

&amp;#x200B;

We invited individuals who were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection at participating hospitals between March 2020-November 2021 to fill an online questionnaire that included baseline demographics, details of their acute episode and information about symptoms they were currently experiencing. Using binomial regression, we compared vaccinated individuals with those unvaccinated and those uninfected in terms of self-reported symptoms post-acute infection.

&amp;#x200B;

**Results** 

&amp;#x200B;

We included 951infected and 2437 uninfected individuals. Of the infected, 637 (67%) were vaccinated. The most commonly reported symptoms were; fatigue (22%), headache (20%), weakness (13%), and persistent muscle pain (10%). After adjusting for follow-up time and baseline symptoms, those who received two doses less likely than unvaccinated individuals to report any of these symptoms by 64%, 54%, 57%,and 68% respectively, (Risk ratios 0.36, 0.46, 0.43, 0.32, p&lt;0.04 in the listed sequence). Those who received two doses were no more likely to report any of these symptoms than individuals reporting no previous SARS-CoV-2infection.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusions**

Vaccination with at least two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was associated with a substantial decrease in reporting the most common post-acute COVID-19 symptoms, bringing it back to baseline. Our results suggest that, in addition to reducing the risk of acute illness, COVID-19 vaccination may have a protective effect against long COVID.",2022-01-26T13:00:13.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2022-01-26T13:00:13.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2022-01-26T13:00:13.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid

To clarify, certainly some particular vaccines designed to combat some particular virus strains, administered to particular cohorts of people should reduce absolute risk of poor health outcomes, for some period of time. The currently available covid vaccines however can present a **higher absolute risk** of poor health outcomes for some cohorts (young males for example) than the virus itself.

"The research seems to be ongoing:


*At this point in time, very rare cases of myocarditis in younger adult men can occur following COVID-19 vaccination, but they are clinically mild and with benign evolution. To date, the benefit-risk assessment for COVID-19 vaccination shows a favourable balance in light of the potential of short- and long-term major cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular complications associated with this disease [3] and the long life-expectancy of this population.*

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8397534/

Edit: 

**Conclusions** 

*Vaccination with mRNA-1273 was associated with a significantly increased risk of myocarditis or myopericarditis in the Danish population, primarily driven by an increased risk among individuals aged 12-39 years, while BNT162b2 vaccination was only associated with a significantly increased risk among women. However, the absolute rate of myocarditis or myopericarditis after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination was low, even in younger age groups. The benefits of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination should be taken into account when interpreting these findings. Larger multinational studies are needed to further investigate the risks of myocarditis or myopericarditis after vaccination within smaller subgroups.*

"Just had an argument with someone.

"**[Attenuated vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine)** 
 
 &gt;An attenuated vaccine (or a live attenuated vaccine, LAV) is a vaccine created by reducing the virulence of a pathogen, but still keeping it viable (or ""live""). Attenuation takes an infectious agent and alters it so that it becomes harmless or less virulent. These vaccines contrast to those produced by ""killing"" the virus (inactivated vaccine). Attenuated vaccines stimulate a strong and effective immune response that is long-lasting.

"Chris Cocking, Principal Lecturer at the School of Humanities and Applied Social Sciences at the University of Brighton, told Reuters that a preferred way to explain crowd action was in terms of “shared identities, relations between different groups and leadership influence”.  
  
He said: “We have all spent our careers trying to undo irrationalist approaches that pathologise crowd behaviour.”  
  
Recent studies on urban disorder, including the 2011 riots in England (here) and the 2005 London bombing (here), have shown that “crowds behave in ordered and normative ways depending on the shared identities experienced by crowd members and the social context in which they happen and they often limit their own behaviour,” Cocking added. “The idea that crowds fall under a mass psychosis which means they are no longer responsible for their actions is a total myth that's not supported by any credible evidence.”

"""Even though digital technologies offered platforms, tools, and applications to monitor, control, and manage information of infected people, they also provided a breeding ground for fake news, myths, and conspiracy theories. The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the rampant misinformation and disinformation as a “massive infodemic” (Fleming, 2020). Misinformation and disinformation have become even more dangerous in the pandemic since they directly impact life and death outcomes. For example, the popular myth that consumption of highly concentrated alcohol could kill the virus had resulted in around 800 mortalities, almost 6000 people being hospitalized (Islam et al., 2020). Some people believed in the conspiracy theory that Covid-19 was spread by 5G wireless towers, resulting in around 80 harassment incidents, 30 acts of arson and vandalism, and even burning cell towers (Satariano and Alba, 2020). Covid-19-related information was also used as a weapon by online hate communities, such as neo-Nazis, fascists, white supremacists, anti-Semites, Islamophobes, cis-gender male supremacists, to push ideas of malicious intents (Velásquez et al., 2021).

The misinformation was also intensified by politicians’ inappropriate speech and decisions, which created more burdens for the information filtering process (or information management process). From February to October 2020, former US President Donald Trump publicly spoke about Covid-19 in an overly hopeful manner, repeatedly stating that the virus would soon “disappear”, “this is like flu”, or “it’s very mild” (Tollefson, 2020; Wolfe and Dale, 2020). At the White House coronavirus taskforce briefing on April 23, 2020, President Trump also suggested the idea of injecting disinfectant as a form of treatment, which caused intense disapproval among healthcare professionals as well as common people not only in the US but around the globe (Smith, 2020). Researchers said that President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration was publicly ignoring them in Brazil. President Bolsonaro also referred to Covid-19 as a “little flu” and undermined vaccines’ value by warning that Covid-19 vaccines could turn people into crocodiles (France24, 2020; Taylor, 2021). The situation was so grave that many leading scientific journals, such as Nature, Science, and The Lancet, had to increasingly cover politics to prevent some political leaders’ misunderstanding, misusing, or even suppressing Covid-19 related research (Jeffrey, 2020; Lancet, 2020; Nature, 2020).

The effectiveness of vaccine distribution and injection heavily depends on public perception of the vaccines. Misinformation about Covid-19 could lead to challenges to implementing public health strategies and vaccination. ""

Yes, viral load can be similar with breakthrough infections... but the likelihood of infection IS MUCH HIGHER without a vaccine. Basic stuff here, buddy.

"Good on you for wanting to inform others with the facts. Everyone deserves to know the risks and benefits of any procedure. J&amp;J is one of the ""traditional"" type vaccines, while Moderna and Pfizer are the mRNA type. Despite their recent confusing advice and guidelines, I would still use the CDC as one solid source. There is a lot of overlap in side effects, but there are also unique concerns with each.

**Traditional: J&amp;J**

*J&amp;J* In the arm where you got the shot: Pain, Redness, Swelling

Throughout the rest of your body: Tiredness, Headache, Muscle pain, Chills, Fever, Nausea

Specific serious concern: blood clots with low platelets, aka thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS 3.83 cases per million

**mRNA type: Pfizer and Moderna**

*Moderna* In the arm where you got the shot: Pain, Redness, Swelling

Throughout the rest of your body: Tiredness, Headache, Muscle pain, Chills, Fever, Nausea

Rare/serious: myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammation) more common after 2+ doses than just one, anaphylaxis (so important to read the ingredient list)

*Pfizer* In the arm where you got the shot: Pain, Redness, Swelling

Throughout the rest of your body: Tiredness, Headache, Muscle pain, Chills, Fever, Nausea

Rare/serious: myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammation) more common after 2+ doses than just one, more common in young men, anaphylaxis (so important to read the ingredient list)

\-

Also, there are other unique but usually not serious effects that could happen with any of the vaccines, like swelling at injection site that goes away after a while.

**Anecdotal:** I, too had been concerned about where to find these numbers and what to trust about what someone could expect when receiving any of these. So, I've been keeping track from people I know personally. J&amp;J, mainly sore arm; Moderna feeling hit by a truck a few hours after, needing rest, sore arm that lasted in some cases, several days; Pfizer, extreme fatigue like unable to operate heavy machinery immediately after, tingling nerves, extreme headache that lasted for days, sore arm. That said, all of these things have long since resolved and I don't think any of them regret it, except the J&amp;J recipients, since it is now not recommended to get it as strongly as the mRNA vaccines and they feel like they missed out since they had fewer doses and always will, even with boosters.

Even though it's not an apples to apples comparison, you could google ""VAERs report + (another vaccine name, for example ""Gardasil"" (HPV vaccine) or ""MMR vaccine"" (measles, mumps, and rubella)) to compare reports and find studies. If you have any questions about how to interpret what you see or how to perform the searches, please feel free to send me a message!

That information is usually on the CDC links (they provide a lot more than what I linked). Mainly for the more serious stuff, not just if the arm hurt (those are the more commonly reported things, they might break it down for some like 1 in 5, etc). You might also find specific studies of links like to heart inflammation. It takes a long of time for this research to come in. It starts with people reporting - anything and everything.

The problem is, anyone can make a report, even if they never had the shot (and just want to lie). Later, they need to study the VAERs reports, verify the information and find potential causal link between the shot and the condition. It's good research to verify and carefully study a group of people relevant to the condition, but it would not be good science to only draw conclusions from VAERs reports, so it takes time.

Additionally, I think this is the most widely circulated vaccine ever, so even numbers you need to take a grain of salt with; in general the more people you give a vaccine to, the more effects you see overall, and some of them may be serious. Does that make sense? Feel free to contact me if you'd like to learn more about this process or help guide you through searching on one of the conditions of concern so you can learn how to do any of them for yourself.

Also, please encourage them to look into side effects for things like polio vaccine and others that might have really unpleasant side effects - but in light of the risks of the actual disease, the benefits clearly outweigh them. For many people, that is the case with the covid vaccine.",2022-01-18T15:00:18.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2022-01-18T15:00:18.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_unknown,2022-01-18T15:00:18.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

"There was a big NIH study in October on which COVID booster is most effective, comparing Moderna 100mcg, Pfizer 30mcg, and J&amp;J. It found that regardless of which of Moderna, Pfizer, and J&amp;J the individual got for their primary series, a Moderna 100mcg booster is most effective. However, the dose that was later approved by the US FDA and CDC, and which is being administered now, is Moderna 50mcg, not 100mcg. So the study doesn't really tell us which of the boosters we can actually get is most effective.

But when it came time to finalize the doses for the boosters, Moderna reduced theirs to a half dose, so only 50mcg, while Pfizer kept theirs at what was previously their full dose, 30mcg.

"There was in fact an update, 3 days ago, to the NIH study I mentioned in OP, but it's not entirely complete. It adds some Omicron data and adds some data for Moderna 50mcg boosters. However, with regard to Moderna 50mcg boosters, it only adds data for Moderna primary series + Moderna 50mcg booster, and not, for example, Pfizer primary series + Moderna 50mcg booster. The antibody numbers for Moderna primary series + Moderna 50mcg booster also seem to be higher than for Moderna primary series + Moderna 100mcg booster, which doesn't make sense, so not sure what to make of that.

"Hello, yesterday I got my first dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid19 vaccine. I have heard about potential fever and slight pain in arm and I had it, so far it was fine.

I have glomerulonephritis and mononucleosis (from kidney I believe), which stopped bothering me about 9 years ago back in my childhood. It's a somewhat creepy disease combination and discussing it was kind of a taboo in my family due to painful memories of trying to heal me. One of the main symptoms I remember (and sometimes the only one occuring) is swelling of particular body parts, most often eyelids in the morning, and this stuff is supposed to be only the beginning. My parents were convinced that getting vaccinated is out of question for me as I had these two diseases and vaccine will damage my immune system and make it resurface or something. It sounded like gibberish, and my brother has the same diseases (but from lungs or something), he got vaccinated and it was fine for him.

This night I woke up at about 4 a.m. and noticed that my eyelids are somewhat swollen, reminding me of my forgotten diseases that I was warned against. Naturally, I was utterly terrified. The swelling stopped about five hours later, but I worry that it may return next morning and is a beginning of resurface process of the two diseases. Is that the case, or is it a more or less normal unrelated reaction to the vaccine and will soon stop?",2022-01-12T09:04:40.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid,2022-01-12T09:04:40.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2022-01-12T09:04:40.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid

 Noroviruses represent the most important cause of acute gastroenteritis   
worldwide; however, currently no licensed vaccine exists. Widespread   
vaccination that minimizes overall norovirus disease burden would   
benefit the entire population, but targeted vaccination of specific   
populations such as healthcare workers may further mitigate the risk of   
severe disease and death in vulnerable populations. While a few   
obstacles hinder the rapid development of efficacious vaccines, human   
trials for virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccines show promise in both  
 immune response and protection studies, with availability of vaccines   
being targeted over the next 5–10 years. Ongoing work including   
identification of important norovirus capsid antigenic sites,   
development of improved model systems, and continued studies in humans   
will allow improvement of future vaccines. In the meantime, a better   
understanding of norovirus disease course and transmission patterns can   
aid healthcare workers as they take steps to protect high-risk

"Sometime in December, my father came home with COVID. He was coughing, hacking and self-medicating with whiskey. I got sick, but thought it was just a cold, so two days later, I went out with my friends. Big mistake.

I could not stop hacking and coughing. Bear in mind that I just finished chemo and radiation and had the two vaccine doses plus the booster. I would have no realization how those shots saved my life! 

By December 26th, I was admitted into the ER for hacking and coughing. I was given the COVID swab test and one day after I got discharged, I got the results. I was positive. With Omicron so I didn't qualify for those mononuclear antibodies.

After antibiotics didn't work, I went back to the ER, this time, being whisked away from my mother and put into the COVID ward of the ER. No privacy except for curtains and I was given a full breakfast, but after choking, they changed the menu to minced after getting me into a room.

For the better part of a week, I hacked and coughed. I never left my small hospital room and never left my bed except to go to the washroom. I was on supplemental oxygen and had to either use a nasal cannula or be on a full oxygen mask. Fun times. At least I had WiFi and my phone and tablet to keep me occupied. I watched Encanto, WandaVision and Squid Game (again).

Discharge day came and I was so dazed and out of it. I was given prescriptions for meds like Remdesivir to help me get over COVID. I'm home now and still a bit dizzy, but otherwise fine.

"When vaccinated people catch COVID, they're far less likely to develop severe disease and they're far more likely to survive if they're hospitalized. Did you read the part where this person is undergoing chemo? They're immunocompromised and smart for getting vaccinated to protect themselves. And the vaccine worked.

If anyone has left the realm of logic, it's people who willfully refuse to understand how vaccines work. There are people drinking bleach and urine and taking testosterone blockers because they ""don't know"" what's in the the vaccines but they trust drinking bleach and urine and taking testosterone blockers to keep COVID at bay.

"You would evolve into a velociraptor. Seriously, though, why are you even asking this question and not just getting a Pfizer booster shot? The Pfizer booster is literally the same amount of vaccine as each of the 2 shots in the first vaccine series. Doses 1 and 2 are to teach your body how to fight COVID. Dose 3 (the booster) is to raise your antibody levels back up so they can be ready to fight COVID if you get it. Your body still knows how to fight COVID, so you wouldn't need a 4th dose until a 2nd booster is recommended (based on how soon antibodies wane after dose 3).

"From the article:

""Patently false statement. The headline (On Facebook) is ludicrous,"" said Dr. Robert Wachter, professor and chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.

The headline alludes to a report that claims that six months of Pfizer’s own data shows that the company’s vaccine caused ""increased sickness and death.""

That report ""completely misstates"" the Pfizer data, said Dr. Matthew Laurens of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. ",2022-01-08T01:00:45.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_unknown,2022-01-08T01:00:45.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_unknown,2022-01-08T01:00:45.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid
"These two extreme examples show that the rate of COVID-19 deaths in Foard County, Texas since 6/30/21 is more than 301 (30,100%) times the rate of COVID-19 deaths in Kauai County, Hawaii since 6/30/21.   
    
01/05/2022 — Vaccination Rates: All 3,144 U.S. Counties (50 states + D.C) — The data shows a pattern of lower vaccination rates and higher COVID-19 death and case rates in most counties where most voters leaned to Trump in the 2020 election.  
    
The disparity in the rates of COVID-19 deaths and cases in most U.S. counties where most voters leaned to Trump in the 2020 election is sad and tragic.  
                              
In the report, the data in the [updated Google Spreadsheet with all the relevant data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/100BFc0VppVL8CIhaNh5ZiTFGBNCnGBdYzfqISAWxln8/edit#gid=0 ""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/100BFc0VppVL8CIhaNh5ZiTFGBNCnGBdYzfqISAWxln8/edit#gid=0"") link shows the correspondence between the percentile of Trump voters in each one of 3,144 U.S. counties, the higher rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths in most counties where most voters leaned to Trump in the 2020 election, and the lower rates of vaccination in most counties where most voters leaned to Trump in the 2020 election.  
            
The following select comparisons between two specific counties show the extreme differences between the two counties out of a field of 3,144 counties. A comparison of other counties predictably will show much less extreme differences. Users can compare any of the 3,144 counties. The data excludes vaccine booster doses because ""data for 3rd/booster shots aren't available at the county level in most states yet"".   
            
The data in the spreadsheet shows Foard County, Texas has a population of 27,249, and 80.76% of votes were for Trump in the 2020 election. Since 6/30/21, the rate of COVID-19 deaths in the county is 821.9178 per 100,000. As of 1/05/22, 43.93% of the Foard County population received 2 doses of a 2-dose vaccine or 1 dose of the single-dose J&amp;J vaccine.   
               
In contrast, Kauai County, Hawaii has a population of 73,298, and 34.58% of votes were for Trump in the 2020 election. Since 6/30/21, the rate of COVID-19 deaths in the county is 2.7286 per 100,000. As of 1/05/22, 70.28% of the Kauai County population received 2 doses of a 2-dose vaccine or 1 dose of the single-dose J&amp;J vaccine.

"**[Lord Haw-Haw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Haw-Haw)** 
 
 &gt;Lord Haw-Haw was a nickname applied to William Joyce, who broadcast Nazi propaganda to the UK from Germany during the Second World War. The broadcasts opened with ""Germany calling, Germany calling"", spoken in an affected upper-class English accent. The same nickname was also applied to some other broadcasters of English-language propaganda from Germany, but it is Joyce with whom the name is now overwhelmingly identified.
 
**[Tokyo Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Rose)** 
 
 &gt;Tokyo Rose (alternative spelling Tokio Rose) was a name given by Allied troops in the South Pacific during World War II to all female English-speaking radio broadcasters of Japanese propaganda. The programs were broadcast in the South Pacific and North America to demoralize Allied forces abroad and their families at home by emphasizing troops' wartime difficulties and military losses. Several female broadcasters operated using different aliases and in different cities throughout the Empire, including Tokyo, Manila, and Shanghai.

# Scientific facts vs personal opinion about vaccines, evolution, climate change

&amp;#x200B;

When I write, I usually stick to scientific facts that are supported by  evidence published in peer-reviewed biomedical journals. Because I can  be rather blunt about a scientific topic, for example, stating that  evolution is a fact, it may sound like I’m saying “my opinion is that  evolution is a fact.” No, it’s a scientific fact, not a personal  opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to opinions vs scientific facts, there is a difference, a  huge difference. An opinion is a preference for or judgment of  something, generally supported by weak evidence. Or sometimes no  evidence. A scientific fact only exists because there is a vast amount  of supporting evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

My favorite color is blue or green, depends on the day. I think that  mint and mushrooms taste horrible, and I can’t imagine what they’d taste  like together. *Doctor Who* is boring. Soccer is even more  boring to the point of inducing depression. These are all my opinions,  meaning that evidence, especially the scientific kind, probably could  not be found to support any of them (see Note 1).

&amp;#x200B;

Opinions may be unique to me alone or massively shared across the  general populations but they all have one thing in common – they cannot  be verified by evidence, except that I believe them.

&amp;#x200B;

There’s nothing wrong with an opinion on those things. The problem comes  from people whose opinions are actually misconceptions. If you think  vaccines cause autism you are expressing [something factually wrong](https://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/4/456.full),  not an opinion. The fact that you may still believe that vaccines cause  autism does not move your misconception into the realm of valid  opinion. Nor does the fact that many others share this opinion give it  any more validity.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other side are scientific facts, which only exist because of  evidence – unbiased evidence, along with well-designed experiments that  give us that evidence. Let’s take a look at opinions vs scientific  facts, just in case you think they are equivalent.

## Scientific facts

&amp;#x200B;

When I write about scientific facts, I spend hours searching and  actually reading sources (there’s something novel, because I have an  opinion that most people don’t read beyond headlines). I see where the  evidence leads me. Of course, I’m not going to spend a lifetime reading  every article about evolution, because there must be literally  millions of articles published about it.

&amp;#x200B;

The scientific consensus on evolution is well established, and who am I  to provide any evidence contradicting it. I’m not an arrogant narcissist  who thinks my own rhetoric contradicts said facts about evolution.

...

## Opinions vs scientific facts

So what are opinions vs scientific facts – how can we tell?

&amp;#x200B;

There’s nothing wrong with an opinion about something when that  opinion cannot be objectively and scientifically supported. In fact, in  the scientific method, an opinion could be like a hypothesis, and  through experimentation, one could conceivably turn an opinion into  fact. But don’t conflate them.

...

The problem with opinions arises when people conflate their opinions,  which are based on anything but evidence, with facts. If you have the  opinion that vaccines cause autism, you are expressing [something that is factually wrong](https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/aluminum-in-vaccines-not-linked-to-autism-james-lyons-weiler-begs-to-differ/) – it is not an opinion. You are scientifically and objectively wrong, based on mountains of evidence.

Even if you believe that your opinion is right, it does not make it so.  It’s still wrong. And just because you can troll the internet finding  others who share that misconception, again does not move it into the  realm of fact. It merely means you’ve found like-minded people who are  also wrong. Your wrong opinion is still wrong, and it has no validity.  None.

McIntyre provides a useful analysis  
of how to identify science denial. He describes five elements that are almost  
always part of the arguments: cherry-picking evidence; belief in conspiracies  
around the issue;reliance on fake experts; logical errors; and setting  
impossible levels of evidence for any opposing views. Given this, McIntyre  
explains that combating science denial can be done by correcting the  
inaccuracies of the science, but also by pointing out the fallacies in the mode  
of thinking, known as technique rebuttal.

"I'm sorry for your son's suffering, and your financial hardship. I've had a family member go through something similar a few weeks ago in an overcrowded hospital. 

While unvaxinated people share the blame as the fuel on this fire,, I've shifted most of my blame to an insubstantial health care infrastructure. Before Covid hospitals were at something like 70 or 80% capacity, and health care front liners were already tirelessly overworked and miserable. There was not NEARLY the amount of workers or floor space available to begin with.

In the past, I feel like we could adapt. The last time we had war powers in action, assembly lines created the arsenal of democracy. We're 2 years into this thing, with vaccines and even successful treatments, but we STILL can't staff a hospital or have enough beds for even the vaccinated people who are struggling! 

In a city of 50,000 people, the hospital was already 30 beds from failure. Losing something like 3% of the nursing staff in my state has crippled us, and dozens of hospitals have shut down overnight emergency rooms.

Vaccinating people will help ease the burden, but the system still needs to change. It's like everyone is trying signs that say ""More Wages!"". No one is trying a sign that says ""40 Hour Work weeks!""",2021-12-31T16:16:20.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2021-12-31T16:16:20.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2021-12-31T16:16:20.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid

"**The bottom line**

&amp;#x200B;

Based on the science, there is reason to be hopeful that supplements such as vitamin C or D, zinc, or melatonin mighthelp in the fight against COVID-19. While there’s no proof yet thatthey do, additional research could show a benefit in certain situations,or with a different dose or formulation of the supplement. So it’sworth keeping an open mind.

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime, we should not dismiss the findings of negative studiesjust because the results weren’t what we’d hoped. When it comes to preventing or treating COVID-19, I’d rely more on the recommendations from the CDC than on unproven supplements.

That children actually died from COVID heart inflammation?

That COVID is a top ten cause of death for children in the US?  

Not to mention the millions permanently damaged by COVID.  

Kids with a ""mild"" case of COVID that have permanent lung damage even 50 year old smokers don't have.

The vaccinated are not filling the hospitals with heart inflammation, it's the unvaccinated doing so.

If the people not vaxxing, not distancing, not masking were only hurting themselves that would be one thing.  But they are killing others by filling hospitals who then cannot adequately treat kids with cancer or adults with heart attack.

They are infecting the caretaker picking up water for the young man who has quarantined at home for two years because they are one of the few people who cannot get vaxxed.  Then that caretaker brings it to that person.

The mutations cause havoc.

Again 1 in every 500 Americans is dead from this in 20 months.  And not a dignified, pain free death.  COVID death is isolation and physical torture.  It is not easing off into twilight.  It is being separated from loved ones while you experience physical torture for days or weeks before you finally succumb.

Not to mention the permanent lung, heart, brain, hair, and erection damage to the survivors.

"""risk is more than the risk associated with the ailment""

There is much, much, more risk associated with COVID than with the Vaccine.

COVID has killed 1 out of every 500 Americans in 20 months, more than AIDS killed in more than half a century.

5 million dead from COVID.

9 billion doses of the vaccine SUCCESSFULLY administered
 
But ultimately you don't get to impose yourself as public health risk.  Your freedom ends where your neighbor's nose begins.

There are very, very few legitimate medical reasons someone can't get vaxxed.  The few legitimate ones are the reason why 85% -90% of the population needs to get the vaccine.

You can drive drunk on your own property if you are not near structures or people.  But the moment you come out on the road you are a hazard.

"It's about reduced risk, not a magical force field.

Those who vax are less contagious, less symptomatic, and less of a danger to their fellow man.  Not to mention they are more likely to mask, test, and distance.

If they get exposed they are less likely to need hospitalization by far, and their time sick is usually much much shorter than an unvaxed person.

Again, public safety, not an impermeable bubble.  This is 2021, not Star Trek.",2021-12-30T17:07:54.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2021-12-30T17:07:54.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_unknown,2021-12-30T17:07:54.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid
"Firstly, the vaccinated are much, much, much less likely to spread COVID.

Secondly, if they do get exposed because they are vaccinated their symptoms will be less severe and they will be sick for a shorter period of time, meaning they are not as contagious and they have fewer symptoms that infect people (sniffles, coughing).

Thirdly, the vaccinated are much, much more likely to be tested, to mask regardless of their COVID status) to distance, and to quarantine if they have a positive test.

Antivaxxers are much less likely mask, or distance or qurantine even if they are COVID positive.

I go by public health experts, immunnologists, and virologists, not people who don't understand the basics about vaccines, particularly this one.

The scared little babies are the ones who think 9 billion successsfully delivered doses it ""too scawy"" but are fine with the 5 million COVID dead and the hundreds of millions permanently debilitated.

Again if it were a victimless crime at this point I'd say to the anti-vax crew fine, you get to die if you want to, but they are spreading and mutating this thing at a huge speed, and they so conveniently distrust the vaccine which is the most medically scrutinized vaccine in all human history, but yet somehow then want medical attention from hospitals once they're very sick or dying from COVID.

If anti-vaxxers quarantined and opted out of medical attention since their confusion about what medical science is has them too scared to take a vaccine  that would be one thing (by the way almost the entirety of those same groups of people were fine being jabbed by the military, or even just getting a vaccine to take a five day vacation to Costa Rica, and suddenly in the past five years became antivax even though the main COVID vaccines are more effective and fewer risks than any other commonly given vaccine in the US) but they are infecting those who work in high-exposure-to-the-public positions like grocer stockers and gas station attendants and hospital workers of all stripes.  They are responsible for rapid-fire mutations of this thing which could result in us needing to develop another vaccine, and they are filling hospitals with the dead and dying.

"Really depends on the country and state and country.  In my state masks were only ever enforced in a few public/government positions.  Even retail stores that have mask guidelines are constantly visited by people not reading the signs or ignoring them and having to be kicked out for trespassing (and by then the entire unit is exposed).

For instance in Arizona, the most anti-mask state and with growing but still inadequate vaccination percentages almost no place requires a mask, large events have been held for over a year often not requiring masks, and the governor has for the most part left it up to the individual, which, in the most anti-mask state, you can imagine how that goes.

The threshold would be ideally 93% of humanity (85% we will see significant traction).  We're not near that yet and borders in even places like New Zealand weren't fully protected so their numbers go up, especially because (again mostly antivaxxers and antimaskers) have been a primary cause of this thing mutating.

McIntyre provides a useful analysis of how to identify science denial. He describes five elements that are almost always part of the arguments:cherry-picking evidence; belief in conspiracies around the issue;reliance on fake experts; logical errors; and setting  
impossible levels of evidence for any opposing views. Given this, McIntyre  
explains that combating science denial can be done by correcting the  
inaccuracies of the science, but also by pointing out the fallacies in the mode  
of thinking, known as technique rebuttal.

Key Findings

From September 4 through October 1, 2021:

*Unvaccinated people were 13 times more likely to become infected with COVID-19 than fully vaccinated people.*

*Unvaccinated people were 20 times more likely to experience COVID-19-associated death than fully vaccinated people.*

*Vaccination had a strong protective effect on infections and deaths among people of all ages. The protective impact on infections was consistent across adult age groups and even greater in people ages 12 to 17 years. The protective impact on COVID-19 deaths, which was high for all age groups, varied more widely.*",2021-12-30T01:49:47.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2021-12-30T01:49:47.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2021-12-30T01:49:47.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid

McIntyre provides a useful analysis  
of how to identify science denial.He describes five elements that are almost  
always part of the arguments:cherry-picking evidence; belief in conspiracies  
around the issue;reliance on fake experts; logical errors; and setting  
impossible levels of evidence for any opposing views. Given this, McIntyre  
explains that combating science denial can be done by correcting the  
inaccuracies of the science, but also by pointing out the fallacies in the mode  
of thinking, known as technique rebuttal.

"\&amp;gt; Erroneous social media reports might have complicated personal decision-making, leading to people with lower cognitive ability being vaccine-hesitant. With individuals with lower cognition also experiencing higher rates of COVID-19 in studies conducted prior to vaccine distribution, these new findings are suggestive of a potential additional disease burden.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to ensure I understand this, because there's an area in the second part that doesn't quite seem clear.  They're basically saying that these two statements are true, according to their results:

&amp;#x200B;

1. People who oppose vaccination have lower cognitive ability.

2. People with lower cognitive ability also have higher rates of COVID-19 infections.

&amp;#x200B;

With the second portion, I don't fully understand the cause and effect that they are discussing in talking about ""erroneous social media reports"", and further down in section 5.4 where they state:

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;gt; There has been a deluge of health advice in the current pandemic during an era when news outlets and social media platforms have never been more ubiquitous and influential.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like the broader finding that may be more beneficial to focus on is that social media and other sources of misinformation make it harder for experts to distribute factual, useful information to the general public.  I also wonder if they also considered traditional media issues such as the ""dumbing down"" of content released by public health experts that may have created misleading content as well, which was further exaggerated on social media.  As a result, it would be interesting if there were some analysis of what could be done differently to communicate more effective health information.  Should experts focus on giving soundbites such as, ""everyone just get vaccinated"" instead of the initial complicated tiered approach that had a list of conditions (e.g. if you worked as a first responder, healthcare worker, over age 65, had health issues, etc.)  It doesn't seem to be the scope of this study but it would be interesting to see what tangible suggestions can be made for governments and health experts to communicate better with the public to override the misinformation leading to vaccination hesitancy.",2022-01-18T10:40:00.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2022-01-18T10:40:00.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2022-01-18T10:40:00.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid
"Those are good questions, I think. It seems to me that they're saying that lower cognitive function is associated with believing ""fake news"" and unreliable sources. Gullibility and going with ""gut feelings"" or in-group group think seem to me to be associated with a lack of critical reasoning skills, which would also be associated with lower cognitive scores.

&amp;#x200B;

*There was a linear association for vaccine hesitancy across the full range of cognition scores (p for trend: p &lt; 0.0001).*",2022-01-18T11:33:46.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2022-01-18T11:33:46.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown,2022-01-18T11:33:46.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown
"*In conclusion, people with lower scores on standard tests of cognitive function reported being less willing to take up the future offer of vaccination for COVID-19. It is possible that erroneous social media news reports have complicated decision-making. Special efforts should be made to communicate clear information about vaccine efficacy and safety so that everyone—including those who report being less likely to choose vaccination—can make well-informed choices.*",2021-12-29T07:59:16.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid,2021-12-29T07:59:16.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2021-12-29T07:59:16.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

That said, yadda yadda, everyone's unique, can't tell for sure what will happen. I would recommend planning for a day or two off, if you can (maybe do it on a Friday and rest the weekend), just in case.

However, I've spoken with a lot of people who have had different vaccines, and with the first and second (when back to back) and sometimes third, they tended, but not always, to have a stronger reaction (or ass-kicking, if you will) from one, but not the others.

"Read the Wikipedia article about PolitiFact. It has a section about political bias. Also they got the lab leak story wrong and had to retract their claim. They are not a credible source for information, especially about Covid. They are at best a convenient way to find sources, and their analysis is best ignored as it is often fallacious.

In this particular case, the factor of 41 that Kirsch uses is actually on the lower end of estimates from peer reviewed literature about vaccine side effect under reporting. The people behind VAERS actually admit the factor is over 100.

&gt; Adverse events from drugs and vaccines are common, but underreported. Although 25% of
ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events 
and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
Likewise, *fewer than **1%** of vaccine adverse events are reported.*

Source:
https://openvaers.com/images/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-20116.pdf

So PolitiFact is off the rails in their criticism here, as Kirsch is using the most conservative number he found in the peer reviewed literature, 41 times as opposed to the 100+ times claimed by VAERS itself.

Now I tend to think Kirsch isn't very precise just because child deaths are about the least likely thing to be under reported. But his math is correct and really is the best estimate he can make based on peer reviewed literature. Even if he is off by a factor two, he is basically correct that the vaccine is worse than useless for children.

You don't so much have people getting out of bed and thinking they are well and walking out of the hospital and *then* dropping dead like with the Spanish Flu.

The use of veterinary ivermectin started in South Africa when the second wave of the pandemic hit at the end of last year.

Since then, officials and scientists have repeatedly warned that there is no reliable scientific evidence showing that the drug works against COVID-19. Back in December, the government even banned the importation of ivermectin.


Karim said that South Africa has seen the rise of so-called miracle drugs every time there is a COVID-19 surge. During the first wave, it was the discredited treatment hydroxychloroquine. When cases started surging and people started getting sick during a ravaging second wave, South Africans turned to ivermectin.

The Cochrane Review, a British database which doctors rely on to make informed decisions, released a review of dozens of studies that found no clear difference between the drug and a placebo in the treatment of COVID-19.

"Hey everybody I’m looking for some advice or personal experience. Im 19 years old I’m in decent health and I’m nervous about getting the shot. Im not a anti vaxxer I’ve got all my shots and even had to get rabies shots at one point. Im not scared of needles or anything like that. My current problem is the Covid vaccine, I want to get it but I’m scared. It’s been on my mind forever and I really just want to get past it. I’ve talked to my doctor, friends, and family and most of them encourage getting the shot, execept my dad he is extremely anti Covid vaccine and thinks it’s a plan to kill us or something. I struggle with anxiety and ocd and when I here things like that or you hear stories of heart problems it really sticks in my head and makes it hard to make a decision. A lot of people don’t know this and so they are quick to assume I’m some anti vaccine loon but really I’m just trying make the right decision. I’ve studied all the vaccines and decided I’d probably go with Pfizer since most of my family got it. I just need some help getting over this hump and I need people who are understanding of my situation. My biggest fears in life usually circle back to my health. I just want to live a long life and have a family. This whole situation has been weighing me down for months if anyone can help I’d be grateful. -Ben",2021-12-24T16:59:09.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2021-12-24T16:59:09.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2021-12-24T16:59:09.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid
"Here for you! Awesome that you are thinking about tackling something that has you so nervous. It all comes down to values, I think. Even for antivaxx people, I respect that they just want to follow their values.

So here's what I recommend: you shared what your dad's values are and other people's opinions about what you should do, but what is important to you? So far, it sounds like you value good health and having a family.

Also, please consider the pros/cons of both getting the vaccine, and not getting the vaccine, in addition to how important each aspect is to you. It sounds like one thing really important to you is avoiding health problems. I've paid attention to who I know personally has gotten the vaccine; I know there are bigger studies, but for me, I like to know the results in real people I know.

If you were to choose Pfizer, I can tell you that of the people I've known who had it: all are still alive, even some young and very old people, all had arm pain that lasted 1-3 days, some had headache that persisted for several days, fatigue, slight fever, and one had tingly feeling in their legs. None had new heart problems after the vaccine (one had been dealing with heart issues for decades previously).

There have been reports of heart problems after some of the mRNA vaccines, though if something happened, there are medications to treat it. J &amp; J is no longer recommended for boosters, it still provides some protection, but there is a higher documented risk of blood clots. So, I would understand why you'd want to choose Pfizer if you were to get the shot.

Whatever you choose, nothing feels as good as no longer being stuck about a decision. I think that is the most stressful thing. So, please consider each of these aspects: when it comes to potential side effects, receiving some protection from severe disease, helping limit healthcare strain, family approval or disapproval and any other factors in your pros/cons list to make this important decision. If you want to talk further, you can send me a message!

"You should listen to your doctor. They spent years in medical school and they know how vaccines work better than randos on the internet, especially the ones posting anti-vax memes on this sub. 

If you want to live a long, healthy life, get vaccinated. You're more likely to die from COVID than from a COVID vaccine. Your dad is listening to conspiracy theories, his beliefs are not trustworthy. Do you have a therapist? You could also discuss this with them.

If you've actually researched the vaccines, then you know how few actual cases of severe side-effects there are compared to how many doses have been administered across the world. All of the side-effects you're worried about are more likely to happen if you get COVID. Your chances of dying or being permanently impaired by a COVID vaccine are vanishingly small compared to what could happen to you if you get COVID without being vaccinated. Even if you survive it, you could have long COVID that affects you for months, year, maybe the rest of your life.

The longer you wait, the less protection you'll have against COVID since you need to wait several weeks between the first and second shot and then you have to wait another 6 months for the booster. Go back to your doctor and get a more in-depth answer.

The thing about OCD too that some people might not understand, is that, if you are unsure about the Vax and then you get it.. it very well could be torturous for our OCD mind.  Whatever you decide, just make sure it is because YOU want to do it, not because of pressure from others. You will be better of in the long term.   Also, I don't know if you have heard of it but there is a traditional Vax that is set to seek approval through FDA by year end. It is called Novavax. Might help you to look into it. You may feel more comfortable going with a technology that has been around for a very long time versus MRNA. Clinical trials show a very goof safety profile for this Vax.

"This is so close to correct, but not quite.

There is no ""plan"", it's random genetic drift. Vaccines shutting down viable reproduction ways for the original variant does not ""cause"" new variations, variants just drown out in the majority of the dominant strain infections of the moment.
Since vaccines hinder those original strains more than some variants, those variants now become more visible and even the dominant strain as they can still reproduce largly unhindered.

This is not vaccines pushing viruses to evolve in a certain direction, it's the vaccines showing gaps in what variants  they can protect against. 

So we booster and update vaccines until we reach a managable level, hoping for the virus to mutate into something that does not overwhelm the healthcare systems.

I know women who have had breakthrough menstruation and temporary worsening of whatever health problems they had before. And from what I gather the worst side effects may be caused by accidental blood injection. There is a procedure for making sure it goes into muscle not blood but not everyone follows that procedure, as not every jurisdiction has it in instructions. Nurse draws back slightly to see if blood comes out. If so need to try again.

According to the CDC (and I bring this up precisely because it strikes me as ridiculous) the vaccinated have like one third to one half relative mortality for non-covid causes of death. That sounds batshit crazy to me. I know we could brainstorm some explanations (unvaccinated cancer patients and risk takers) but the effect still seems too large, so I wonder if it is either scientific fraud on the one hand, or the vaccine is actually protecting us from something else (or several things) endemic such as Epstein Barr or maurine leukemia. Or maybe the shock of disrupting double stranded DNA repair is activating some unknown super repair response.

I'm skipping the booster for now now not because I believe or disbelieve anything in particular but because my trust is broken. The idea of getting an alpha variant vaccine to protect from delta and omicron with evolving ADE feels ridiculously short sighted even though the numbers marginally support it at the moment. I don't believe people on top really know what they are doing or who is pulling their strings. The scientific community was rife with fraud before the pandemic to the point that peer reviewed journals could plausibly be social engineered to publish fraudulent articles. BMJ is being censored by Meta while the Lancet publishes blatantly fraudulent studies. Our leaders made ridiculous wrong calls often early on and there remain lots of unanswered questions - including whether this virus had a lab origin and if so, was it released deliberately]p]. But I know how to get antivirals and immunity boosting nutrients from mushrooms and herbs so I'm actually more protected not less.

I still believe the vaccine works and may have more bennefits than we know. I just think it is the T-cell memory that is most valuable, and getting a booster just to boost antibodies against a virus with evolving ADE, using a vaccine that disrupts double stranded DNA repair, isn't something I want to do without far better understanding.",2021-12-24T03:43:00.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown,2021-12-24T03:43:00.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid,2021-12-24T03:43:00.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

Thanks so much for putting it into perspective.
I got the Moderna booster on Monday (after the Pfizer vaccine) and never been so sick before.
The second Pfizer shot wasn't easy either but nothing compared to the booster.

I started freezing and couldn't get warm, then came the fever of 103, body aches etc.

"&gt;Is everyone fine?

Literally? No. In terms of statistical probability though, yeah. The risk is miniscule, especially compared to Corona. 

&gt;Haven't you seen the cases of heart inflammation?

The very rare and easily treatable cases that caused like 3 deaths before they started testing for it in those at risk? Yeah sure.

&gt;The cases of death and severe vaccine injury reported in VAERS, for example?

I'd like to see where you got this information, because again, there's very little that's happened. 

&gt;What you're describing is a live mass vaccine trial

The vaccine was approved for emergency use by the FDA, and now has been approved for full use. The only people saying it's a trial *are* the uninformed.

&gt;They were told that the vaccine would make them immune to infection.

No one was told that. If you have the slightest idea how a vaccine works you should know that's not the case.

That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies. It's basically igniting your own immune system to fight off the virus. It sends messengers to your cells to be able to fight off and create a line of defense before you end up getting terribly ill from covid. This is different than say the flu vaccine where you receive a small dosage of the virus which could trigger an immune response. If you are autoimmune compromised, it seems to me that the vaccine is probably the most helpful thing to prevent you from becoming terminal from covid.

"**[Arrow of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time)** 
 
 &gt;The arrow of time, also called time's arrow, is the concept positing the ""one-way direction"" or ""asymmetry"" of time. It was developed in 1927 by the British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington, and is an unsolved general physics question. This direction, according to Eddington, could be determined by studying the organization of atoms, molecules, and bodies, and might be drawn upon a four-dimensional relativistic map of the world (""a solid block of paper""). Physical processes at the microscopic level are believed to be either entirely or mostly time-symmetric: if the direction of time were to reverse, the theoretical statements that describe them would remain true.

"I think you might be referring to this government website, [https://clinicaltrials.gov/](https://clinicaltrials.gov/). Those listed there do have to be set out in detail, but I believe these are unique to studies that utilize US government money. There are many, many companies that don't, and do their own studies without that money, and so do not post publicly, because they don't have to.

You are right in that companies have an incentive in general to share only positive results and suppress negative findings in order to get approval by government agencies because of the major financial benefits of doing so. For example, to get FDA approval, generally, all a company needs are 2 separate, independent studies showing positive results. Companies have been caught in the past fudging that data by researchers who check over their data, but often, they will not share the data with independent researchers. Keep in mind though, that FDA approval alone doesn't mean much. Usually, if there are problems, it will be found and something done about it much, much after the fact.

The thing is with the vaccine stuff, if we find something, the company will struggle to hide links to their product because 1) vaccine effects are likely to happen in a matter of weeks, maximum, and 2) so many people have taken it. This is why it is really important to report to VAERs if you experience a problem. If something is wrong, it WILL be noticed in the pattern of many people. So far, there are a couple of concerns; for a lot of people, the benefits still outweigh the risks.

Also, I don't think you'll find the specific study you're looking for, because Pfizer did not accept money from the US government. Moderna and Astrazeneca did.",2021-12-18T14:59:18.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2021-12-18T14:59:18.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown,2021-12-18T14:59:18.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

"\*Three major filtration mechanisms are identified, namely, interception,   
inertial impaction and diffusion. While interception takes place for   
nearby particles, inertial impaction is mainly dominated by some large   
particles. Diffusion mechanism primarily applies to small particles with  
 diameters around 0.1 μm. A mask design needs to consider all these   
mechanisms in order to increase the filtration capacity for all particle  
 sizes. As a result, the air filtering respirators are designed to   
prevent both airborne transmission and the droplets, and highly   
recommended for the indoor area especially in the high‐risk environment.  
 Based on these studies, all people, regardless of physical conditions   
and professions, should wear masks at all times in prevention of   
COVID‐19. In this regard, inhalation protection via masks is   
particularly important in order to reduce the transmission of viruses   
that are potentially carried by droplets and aerosols. The mask   
requirement has already been proved to be effective, and recently   
mandated in all states of the United States (Does Your State Have a Mask Mandate Due to Coronavirus?). Considering limited resources in some regions, the home‐made masks are   
shown to have comparable filtration efficiencies compared to the medical  
 masks. A conclusion can be reached based on the current studies:   
correctly wearing masks of all kinds, despite their different designs,   
functions and effectiveness, will to a large degree reduce the overall   
risks of COVID‐19 infection and enhance general protection from   
coronavirus.\*",2021-12-17T01:38:00.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2021-12-17T01:38:00.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid,2021-12-17T01:38:00.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid

"I am ALL for a healthy level of skepticism at labs and corps that have done shady things, and at least slight cynicism about what comes from gov't (&amp; considering their aims for what messages they send, and the timing) but I think your analysis of risk for unvaccinated/vaccinated/boosted groups is flawed because the group sizes are not equal.

That is, you would expect less unvaccinated people to be catching omicron in a population with a higher vaccination rate, simply because there is a larger pool of people with some type of vaccine (or given a place with low masking rates, since using no mask is not going to prevent vaccinated people from catching it, even more than delta).",2021-12-18T02:09:09.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2021-12-18T02:09:09.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_unknown,2021-12-18T02:09:09.000Z,vcc,neutral,vcc_covid

Obviously, will assume that access to testing is a huge problem, but even considering that, where was the extrapolation for 80-90% infected?

We're definitely in agreement that 1) cases of Omicron are increasing, in all places, and 2) being vaccinated and/or boosted will not guarantee you don't get covid, especially the case with Omicron.

Florida was in a similar situation, but for a different reason - hospitals filled up and many places ran out of tests. So another way to infer what was really going on (amidst governor and others encouraging flawed data reporting) was to use other indicators. Out of tests, CO2 and oxygen shortages impacting water use, and the like. So I imagine to come to this conclusion, researchers made creative use of other signs of the spread of covid in Africa.

"Fully boosted only represented 7,5% of population by the time this data rolls out. Unvaccinated represent 20% of population. Double dose represent 76,6% of population.

If the spread is hitting only 9% on unvaccinated (and that number is lowering from 13,8% to 9 in just 3 days), then there is evidence that unvaccinated are not that transmissible, as oposed with the other variants, where the same table shows a high percentage (almost 50%) of unvaccinated with infection of Delta, etc. WHich proves the vaccines do offer somewhat protection against delta and other earlier variants. 

So if you have 7,5% boosted population, and there are 9,5% (and rising) infections reported for the boosted, then there is an enhanced transmission on vaccinated.

"I'm genuinely curious about why you're posting disingenuous bullshit here. Why do you think vaccinated people are ""afraid"" of you unvaccinated COVIDIOTS? We're not afraid of you, we think you're stupid as fuck.

We're tired of your bullshit and the fact that you refuse to do anything whatsoever that could possibly help stop COVID from mutating and becoming stronger and more contagious. You don't just refuse to get vaccinated, you're a bunch of selfish jackasses who also refuse to wear masks or stop going to large gatherings of people where you spread COVID like wildfire. And even when you know you have COVID, you go out in public and knowingly infect people. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if you were just killing yourselves with COVID, but your innocent relatives and children also die because of your stupidity. Innocent people, including healthcare workers, die because of your stupidity.

There are people who are too sick for their bodies to produce very many antibodies even if though they're smart enough to get vaccinated. You shitheels put those people in danger because you spread COVID like it's going out of style and you lie about being infected but still go out and you use fake vaccines cards to get into places you have no business being, especially when you know you have or could have COVID.

The vaccine isn't perfect. People can still get COVID, but they're much less likely to be hospitalized or die. But even though a vaccinated person is less likely to experience severe illness, they can still spread the COVID you gave them to immunocompromised family members. Or babies who are too young to be vaccinated. 

Does it make you feel good to know that you kill people's children and grandparents by refusing to engage in even the smallest and least intrusive public health initiatives? Does it make you feel good that the misinformation you spread causes people to get sick and die because they trusted the lies you tell?

For the anti-vax crowd, (1) is when you say that getting Covid vaccines is dangerous in the long term because there's no proof to the contrary. To enable this fallacious trope, you selectively try to disqualify all the data on all the vaccines in the past that have been guiding vaccine research for over a century. It's willful ignorance.

(2) Is when you say that all the researchers in the world are wrong when they say that the vaccines are safe because there isn't enough data to prove their claims. That the trials were rushed and incomplete, despite the evidence to the contrary. This one demands omniscience, pointing to whatever amount of data that is available and declaring it insufficient.

## Abstract

&amp;#x200B;

**PIP:**                       Randomized controlled clinical trials are conducted to determine  whether differences of clinical importance exist between selected  treatment regimens. When statistical analysis of the study data finds a P  value greater than 5%, it is convention to deem the assessed difference  nonsignificant. Just because convention dictates that such study  findings be termed nonsignificant, or negative, however, it does not  necessarily follow that the study found nothing of clinical importance.  Subject samples used in controlled trials tend to be too small. The  studies therefore lack the necessary power to detect real, and  clinically worthwhile, differences in treatment. Freiman et al. found  that only 30% of a sample of 71 trials published in the New England  Journal of Medicine in 1978-79 with a P value greater than 10% were  large enough to have a 90% chance of detecting even a 50% difference in  the effectiveness of the treatments being compared, and they found no  improvement in a similar sample of trials published in 1988. It is  therefore wrong and unwise to interpret so many negative trials as  providing evidence of the ineffectiveness of new treatments. One must  instead seriously question whether the absence of evidence is a valid  justification for inaction. Efforts must be made to look for  quantification of an association rather than just a P value, especially  when the risks under investigation are small. The authors cite a recent  trial comparing octreotide and sclerotherapy in patients with variceal  bleeding, as well as the overview of clinical trials evaluating  fibrinolytic treatment for preventing reinfarction after acute  myocardial infarction as examples.

They will last at least until Sunday 19 December 5:00 hours."" So it may in part depend on when you plan to travel; in all likelihood this will be extended.

"Flu vaccines aren't vaccines? Flu and covid vaccines fit the medical description of vaccines, so, yeah. They're vaccines.

**Booster Shots Are Common** 

&amp;#x200B;

According to Jason C. Gallagher, PharmD, FCCP, FIDP, FIDSA, BCPS,  
 clinical professor at Temple University’s School of Pharmacy and   
clinical specialist in infectious diseases, boosters are common.

&amp;#x200B;

“Most vaccines that are given in the U.S. require several doses to   
render immunity,” Gallagher tells Verywell. “I like to think of \[a   
COVID-19 vaccine booster\] as the third dose of a multi-dose series.”

&amp;#x200B;

While boosters are common, whether they’re necessary largely depends on the type of vaccine, Jeffrey Langland, PhD, virologist and professor at Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine, tells Verywell.

&amp;#x200B;

“Most vaccines that do not contain a live, attenuated (weakened) virus,   
typically require multiple doses or boosters,” Langland says.

There are some true medical exceptions to getting vaccinated, a very small percentage of the population, much less than would impact the minimum vaccination rate to get better control of this.  Most of the people with those medical exceptions have systems that cannot handle even basic seasonal colds and would have been housebound anyway during these last two years.

"Do you mean why get the vaccine if you already recovered from Covid? Or do you mean why get the vaccine because you think the risk of death from Covid is low?

Covid is highly contagious and going around in the community. The outcome of getting sick from Covid-19 is highly variable, so two people of the same age and health can have very different severity of illness. For many people, it's a very rough ride. The vaccine can reduce the chance of getting sick or landing in the hospital, or the risk of death, by more than 90%. And it reduces the chance of passing the illness to others around you. Some people even get long term symptoms that don't go away for weeks or months, or even permanently (like loss of smell and taste, brain fog, fatigue, lung lesions). Basically the vaccine primes your immune system to resist the virus and gives you a much better chance of fighting off the illness. And it's free and safe -- so that risk of very rare side effects are orders of magnitude less than the risk of getting Covid and getting its negative effects.

"Less people that get the vaccine, the more it spreads and mutates and stays a danger. If you get the vaccine, you might feel bad for a few days and thats it, if you're crazy unlucky you'll have some health issue (even think its not at all as common as some people think), its super unlikely. Theres a good chance youve been vaccinated for all kinds of stuff, especially when you were young, and you're fine now. Its really not that much to ask, for people to take preventive medicine that not only protects you, but protects every other person you might go near in your day to day life. Social media has not only politicized medicine, its demonized it with massive amounts of misinformation because misinformation spreads faster than facts. People think the vaccine is deadly because it causes health issues in a small percent of people, but all medicine has dangers, but people take that risk because they know its small as hell. I bet if a ""news"" company came out talking about and over selling the dangers or Advil, people would be scared of acetaminophen because thats what ""news"" sites do. They play on people's fears for some clicks.

 
 You gotta understand that you have your right to not get ""jabbed"", but companies and even the government have the right to bar you from areas because you could be a genuine health risk, because the vaccine doesn't 100% prevent people from getting covid, its just makes their chances A LOT better. And no one has the right to risk others health because they dont want to do the thing everyone else already did (and the fact that you can have covid for a while and not show it makes it even more of a risk). Get what im saying?
 
 E: as for the government mandating it, im kinda split. I get the frustration, but the whole idea of living in a society is that you give up some freedoms for security and access to stuff you wouldn't have access too otherwise. Yes, mandating the vaccine is a take away from your personal freedom, but its also a very necessary control that makes it safer to be in a society and have access to all the goodies that come with society (like restaurants and jobs).

"Yes, thats evolution in action, but itll mutate and create variants no matter what. It doesnt have to have a pressure. That doesn't mean anything significant, we had to deal with variants popping up when we were fighting polio, but once enough people were vaccinated fast enough(basically everyone) the virus had too much trouble surviving in people long enough and in numbers big enough to out-mutate the vaccination and nowadays polio is considered eradicate in most countries. Its harder for viruses to have useful mutations if its harder for the virus to survive in a body in big enough numbers long enough to have a random useful mutation, and unvaccinated people are just the perfect shop for that virus to mutate in. Just remember that viruses dont ""modify themselves"", they are at the mercy of random genetic errors that might just so happen to help them survive, we just personify stuff to explain away pretty complicated processes that we dont feel like explaining. Viral mutations are at the mercy of randomness, so i bet you can see how letting the virus exist in people in large numbers would give it more chances to have useful mutations.

"You can 100% still get your second dose. There's some evidence that a longer period of time between doses raises the level of antibodies after the 2nd dose, so it's not a disaster that you haven't gotten the 2nd dose yet. There's also evidence that mixing your doses between Pfizer and Moderna can provide more protection. That's what I did for my booster shot.

But make an appointment ASAP, since the booster was approved for everyone and not just high risk people or frontline workers, appointments everywhere are hard to come by. You may end up with an appointment more than a month from now, so it's best to start looking today.

if you have healthcare and your provider is offering vaccinations, that may help get you in sooner. Mine requires an appointment, but it's really just  a formality because it's a walk-in vaccination site in their parking garage basement level that's set up to do high-volume vaccinations.",2021-12-07T20:56:26.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_unknown,2021-12-07T20:56:26.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_unknown,2021-12-07T20:56:26.000Z,vcc,positive,vcc_covid

"Relatively healthy, no health conditions and am not on any medications.

I was one of those who had some gnarly side effects after my first vaccine, because of that, I did admittedly space off my 2nd dose for quite some time. I did however read several studies that did show a relatively high percentage of protection after one dose, so because of that combined with my age I didn't feel too concerned about putting off the 2nd dose.

Now that I have received my 2nd dose 7 months later, I do have some questions about where that puts me as far as being fully ""covered"". 

Am I technically fully covered despite this wide gap - and where does this put me as far as when I should recieve my booster shot?

"Idk about the 7 months interval between 1sr and 2nd shots, but those two articles below could help:

1) [Longer interval between the first and second Pfizer...](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2021/07/pfizer-vaccine-interval-antibody-cells.aspx)

Short: increasing interval between 1st and 2nd increases protection but at the same time, during the interval there's very small protection. You've already have two.


2) [Thee Lancet - Effectiveness of a third dose of Pfizer](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02249-2/fulltext)

*""In this large observational study conducted using nationwide mass vaccination data in Israel, we estimated that a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is effective in preventing severe COVID-19-related outcomes. Compared with two doses of the vaccine administered at least 5 months before, adding a third dose was estimated to be 93% effective in preventing COVID-19-related admission to hospital, 92% in preventing severe disease, and 81% in preventing COVID-19-related death, as of 7 or more days after the third dose.""*


*""...these early findings suggest that a third dose of mRNA vaccine is effective in reducing severe COVID-19-related outcomes for patients who have received two doses at least 5 months before.""*

Short: third dose at least 5 months after is increasing protection.

Again, anecdotal, but Ive also seen how the unvaccinated fair compared to the vaccinated when concerning my friends and family, friends of friends, acquaintances, etc. To say the least, my personal experience combined with the data is evidence enough for me to decide to play it safe and get vaccinated.

COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for people who are pregnant. In addition, everyone who is ages 18 and older, including those who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future, should get a booster shot. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can protect you from severe illness from COVID-19, and a healthy mom is important for a healthy baby. If you are pregnant, you might want to have a conversation with your healthcare provider about COVID-19 vaccination. While such a conversation might be helpful, it is not required before vaccination.

"So, my mother is a nurse at a major hospital here in Michigan, where we currently have more Covid cases than anywhere. She was always a reliable pusher of the flu shot, every year--- but with the Covid Vaccine, she is firmly Anti-Vax.  Please help me defuse her arguments with facts and citations.   


I believe that if we can defeat these common arguing points, we can make a difference and share them with others to help stop misinformation and bad thinking.  


1. She is skeptical of the MNRA technology, primarily. She claims it was not used earlier, because they kept encountering issues with it related to inflammatory response.
2. She claims that the hospital does not allow them to enter vaccine related injuries or health issues on the OSHA forms as part of regulation, and that this is akin to a coverup as ""she sees the logs every day, and there are HUNDREDS of people with issues.""
3. She cites first hand knowledge of knowing people who got the vaccine and had negative side effects including blood clots, thrombosis veins, some girl who apparently cannot stop sneezing and frequently refers to nursing home deaths as proof of the vaccine being dangerous.
4. She says that ""many"" of her medical colleagues share her viewpoints

I don't doubt that she has seen people with real side effects, and people with symptoms they attributed to the vaccine (rightly or wrongly). And she has probably seen people die of COVID, and people recover from COVID, and non-vaxxers who didn't get COVID, and vaxxers who did get it, and EVERYTHING under the sun. Because it's all happened to someone, somewhere. But she should be asking what the ODDS are, going forward, of any of those things happening to her or a loved one. The odds are much better from taking the vaccine, than with not taking it. 

But I'll bet she's heard patients who said ""I'm going to continue smoking. My grandfather smoked, and he lived to be 90"" or some such. And she knows (I hope) that the odds are better if you quit smoking, even though that grandfather was an outlier in the data.

It only looks like cause and effect due to proximity of occurrence. This is expected considering vast swathes of the population are getting vaccinated (although not enough).

You can never overcome ""skeptical"" ...but here's a [pre-COVID article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243) about advances in mRNA technology, stating that the Zika vaccine and rabies vaccine were using mRNA at that time (2018).

Not sure what she means by ""issues related to inflammatory response."" All vaccines are designed to trigger antibodies and cellular response, so...that's an inflammatory response. Thus the flu shot makes your arm hurt or whatever. Vaccines(AND infections themselves, BTW) have the potential to create antibodies that attack normal cells in your body (autoimmune disease, such as Guillain-Barre), or antibodies that actually HELP the infection cause WORSE disease ([antibody-dependent enhancement](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/antibody-dependent-enhancement-and-vaccines)).

"&gt;She claims that more people have had adverse reactions from the vaccine than have had symptomatic covid, which seems fucking impossible.

&lt;&lt; Yeah, on this one, she does seem totally deranged. There have been [48 million cases](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html) of COVID diagnosed in the US. You can have a [""confirmed case""](https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-2021/) just by having a positive test with no symptoms, but it is estimated that that only accounts for [35% of all cases](https://epi.ufl.edu/articles/35-percent-of-all-covid-19-infections-never-show-symptoms.html). So we've had about 65% of those 48 million, or 31 million symptomatic cases in the US.

Adverse reactions from the vaccine? I just did a [VAERS search](https://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html) for all adverse events reported after a COVID shot (any dose, in any patient, anywhere) and got 664,745. That's all reports, ever, related to any of the COVID shots. So even if every single one of them was attributable to the vaccine, it's way less than the 31 million symptomatic COVID patients. 

Of course, there have been adverse events that weren't reported. But there have also been COVID cases who never tested.

""Most seniors I know have Not been vaccinated""

  
Yeah, your personal anecdotal evidence TOTALLY supercedes peer reviewed national data from hospital systems.

  
Secondly   


&amp;#x200B;

&gt;However a recent Israeli study shows that natural immunity is 13 times more effective than vaccines in protecting individuals

""SARS-CoV-2-naïve vaccines had a 13-fold increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected""

HOLY SHIT be dumber.

That means DELTA is stronger, unvaccinated are at an even HIGHER risk than that, a HELL of a lot higher. No surprise you didn't link to the study which would agree with me. Those previously infected were infected with the original strains, not delta, which is significantly stronger and more easily transmitted.

This is an actual relevant quote from that study:

""Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.""AS we've been saying since the beginning, if someone has a previous infection, their best chance of not getting it again is vaccination + their natural immunity.

I even found the Op/Ed where you copy pasted the incorrect conclusion. Think for yourself. ACTUALLY READ THE STUDY ITSELF. You seem to have gotten your conclusion from Clark County Today or some variation thereof: [https://www.clarkcountytoday.com/news/israeli-study-shows-natural-immunity-delivers-13-times-more-protection-than-covid-vaccines/](https://www.clarkcountytoday.com/news/israeli-study-shows-natural-immunity-delivers-13-times-more-protection-than-covid-vaccines/) which has an identical headline to the text you wrote about your quote, which didn't back up your statement.

Not to mention, chance of breakthrough infection - MOST BREAKTHROUGH INFECTIONS FOR VACCINATED ARE MILD AT WORST. So again - LOOK AT THE DEATH RATE, AS WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN SAYING.

Unvaxxed gets covid and dies.Vaccinated might get a breakthrough reaction, but they survive just fine.

"Hey Reddit folkx. Buckle up, I got a lot to spill this afternoon.

I'm  a 30 year old female, and my husband is a 36 year old make. He is an  ex-smoker and is in semi-okay shape I guess. He works in film, and is  exposed to hundreds of people on film sets every day. He gets COVID  tested multiple times per week, and they're pretty careful on film sets,  but not everyone is vaccinated. Additionally, there were a few COVID  outbreaks on set last year around flu season, and the testing definitely  proved to be more of a stop-gap measure and tracing tool as opposed to  protection against the virus.

I am  fully vaccinated and vehemently pro-vaccination. I don't want to tell  other people what to do with their bodies, but my husband and I share a  home, and I am nervous.

At the  beginning of COVID, my housemates' father died from the disease. This  really hit home for me, as my 70 year old father recently recovered from  Prostate Cancer and his immune system is pretty messed up from the  treatments. On top of this, he has a blood disorder, and a pulmonary  issue (he was treated for 20 blood clots in his lungs recently as well).  As such, this pandemic has made me extremely anxious about the health  of my family. My parents basically lived up north in a remote cabin and  only Skyped us for an entire year. My family and I are extremely close.  Even when I was living abroad, they came to visit me several times. Not  seeing them for so long was painful.

With  the vaccine rolling out, we all felt extremely hopeful about the  possibility of getting together in person again. My sister, and both  parents are full vaccinated. We have slowly started meeting for dinners  and get togethers. It has been wonderful.

Unfortunately,  my parents as well as my entire extended family have set some firm  boundaries about vaccine status at family get togethers. Given the  health of my father, as well as the health of my elderly uncles and  young cousins (who aren't vaxxed yet as they're under 12), we are not  okay with getting together with anyone who is unvaccinated. My mom has  brought this up leading up to the holidays, and was in tears about the  fact that we can't include my husband unless he gets vaccinated. My  parents love my husband dearly, and we have only been married for 2  years. It breaks their hearts that the whole family cannot be together  over the holidays. My cousins and aunts have also raised their eyebrows  about him not being able to join us for Christmas get togethers, and  I've had to defend my husband to my family despite me not agreeing with  his decision AT all.

Additionally,  I have several friends who have expressed concern about the possibility  of me spreading the virus, given that I live with an unvaccinated  person who is exposed to other un-vaxxed people daily.

During  the previous winter, when COVID rates were super high where we live, he  wasn't that careful. He had an emotional affair in the winter, and he  lied to me about going over to this woman's house after Christmas when  both of us had seen our families and could therefore spread the virus.  Him and this woman shared joints, cigarettes, had a charcuterie board  together.. then he came back and exposed my entire household to whatever  she could have been carrying. Luckily, none of us got COVID, but he  didn't really recognize or acknowledge the fault in his faulty decision  making. I disclosed this to my close circle of friends, as it was  causing my great distress, and all of them grew even more weary about  being exposed to his sloppy antics through me (given that we live  together).

As such, and given the  fact that I can also spread the virus to my husband, I have had to live  isolated despite being fully vaccinated. I feel isolated from friends  and family, and it's driving me mad because I was one of the first  people in my friends group to get fully vaccinated and have been one of  the most careful people with COVID.

My  husband's entire extended family is super anti-vax, conspiracy theory,  Q-ANON, Right-wing idiots about this all. None of them are vaccinated,  even his older uncle who goes into the hospital on a weekly basis for  kidney dialysis treatments. There are so many young kids in his family  that  go to daycare, and kidney disease is genetic. His mother recently  contracted covid and proudly boasted being fine after. His family and  mother frequently compare getting vaccinated with being sent to gas  chambers, and liken how Governments are handling to pandemic to  Holocaust-era Nazi Germany. My Great Uncle is a survivor of Auschwitz  and my grandfather is a WW2 vet. Nothing disgusts me more than people  using the Holocaust as a talking point for COVID related issues. As  such, I have severed ties with several of his family members. I have  politely refused to get together with them throughout the course of the  pandemic. They have been getting together a lot, seeing friends, living  their lives as though there is no pandemic. This has really upset  several members of his family, including his mother, who is now in my  husband's ear about how I ""don't like her"", and how my husband should  just sneak around and see his family without telling me. He obviously  won't be doing this. I'd like to point out the fact that my  mother-in-law has been the cause of a lot of issues, and likely has a  personality disorder. She is abusive, and highly manipulative. She has  made our lives a living hell at times and my husband hasn't set firm  boundaries with her about this. She has been the cause of many, many  issues throughout our entire relationship. She has even been so bold as  to insult both of my parents at our wedding, which my parents planned  and paid for entirely without the help of his family.

His  extended family has criticized me for my decision to get fully  vaccinated, and claims that I am against freedom of speech and am  judgmental.

I'd also like to point  out how my family has been nothing but helpful and supportive to my  husband, despite his decision to not get vaccinated. The double standard  kills me.

Back in September, I  almost convinced him to get vaccinated. He agreed to do it, but never  did, and when we discussed it again, said he won't get it. I booked him  an appointment and he immediately made me cancel it.

His  reasoning for not wanting to get the vaccine have been: that he has a  heart condition- which I have never heard about. Apparently he has a  heart murmur? Which I believe would be even worse if he got COVID? I've  been with him for 7 years and this is the first I've heard of his heart  problem. I have been with him to several doctors appointments and it has  never come up until certain friends ask him about his vaccination  status. The other answer is that he had a prophetic dream, where higher  powers were warning him against getting vaccinated. Apparently, these  same higher powers told him about the pandemic before it happened, and  protected him from a COVID outbreak on one of his sets last winter. He  says he can't explain it, but that I need to trust him. Ridiculous,  right? He very passionately dis-aligns himself with being an  anti-vaxxer, he just claims that he is hesitant and waiting for a  non-MRNA vaccine. When I ask him about this in more detail, he can't  explain it. He has a grade 9 high school education tops (he dropped  out), and while I think he's smart, he is no medical doctor.

Anyways,  this has all been too much for me to handle. I do not want to live  isolated, and I feel extremely unsafe sharing a household with him. I  have sat him down several times to discuss the safety of the vaccine, as  have many people. I have informed him several, several times about how  his decision has made me feel unsafe in our home, has made me feel  isolated, and is generally causing a great deal of tension in our  relationship. He comes back with ""you don't think I feel upset too?"" and  then shoots back about how I could also be putting him in danger by  going out and living my life without regard for COVID transmission, even  though I'm vaccinated.

I have  told him to move out. I cannot handle this. He says he will get  vaccinated by Christmas, but I have not seen any effort to do so. We  have pop-up vaccine clinics EVERYWHERE in our city. He could get a first  dose on his work lunch breaks. No dice. I do not see any plan to get  the vaccine. He is also not making any moves to move out. I broke up  with him last week, and this week, we discussed couples therapy, but I  see NO work from him so far. He doesn't even bring up our breakup with  me. When I have candid conversations with him and clearly communicate  how I'm feeling, he sits there and says nothing.

There  have been several other things that have come up in our relationship, I  am just focusing on this. Please be gentle with me, but fuck...

The real number of people who get hospitalized due to Covid is likely below 1% and it would be a lot lower if the medical community acted responsibly.

"Serious appreciation for respecting his and his family's values. You're the best kind of pro-vaccine person, one that respects others' choices and values, despite also living through painful personal experiences with covid that hit close to home. But this is impacting you significantly. You deserve to be able to protect yourself as you see fit, and live and enjoy freedom of movement in your life as much as you would like.

If you still don't want to give up on potentially getting him vaccinated, it sounds like mere education is not being effective right now. One thing that could help is exploring his values and concerns. For instance, the dream he described, and the specific health condition with his heart are good jumping off points. One very effective method to work on someone's resistance is show real empathy. Addressing his statement ""you don't think I feel upset too"" is one way of potentially helping him feel heard so he can open up. Though you disagree with his position and his family's position, it sounds like he might also feel pulled in multiple direction. You referenced qanon people in his family, and there are sentiments within that group that even being around someone who has been near someone else who has been vaccinated puts one at risk. So he might feel like he already can't win, one way or the other. That could help explain his comment that you could ""be putting him in danger"" by going and living your life.  
  
Since you've told him to move out and broken up, it sounds like him getting the vaccine really isn't the point. You said it yourself, if he had the slightest bit of motivation to get it, he could absolutely have it by now (though if avoiding mRNA vaccines was his main goal, he could just go with J&amp;J if he's in the US).

Give him until January if you want to, but if he still refuses to get vaccinated you have to do what's best for you. 

Your father, especially, is frail. You should spend as much time as you can with him before he's gone. If your husband is an obstacle to this goal, remove him. You will not forgive yourself OR your husband if he prevents you from spending time with your father and you lose your father before you can see him again.

"Do not ruin your marriage over this. This is absolutely ABSURD. Let him make his own medical decisions and you can make yours!! This vaccine has been out for a year and anyone that gets it is still part of a clinical trial!! You cannot push, force, coerce or shame someone into this. And to isolate and exclude someone from social gatherings, especially family is disgusting to be frank. I strongly disagree with your family for setting those boundaries. These vaccines are not known to be truly safe or effective. The only vaccine that is even still above 50% effective , is moderna. Pfizer and J&amp;J are down to like 38% apparently. These kind of “boundaries” are going to mentally and emotionally destroy people when you start to isolate them because they want to have medical freedom and wait until there is more research and TIME to collect data. I commend you for being open minded towards him and his family, but I would tell you to start looking at your own family and wondering if maybe those boundaries are not healthy..

Personally I think if they are vaccinated , those that are susceptible to covid (dying or injuries), you’re in the clear and you should not worry about those who are not. Let him get tested and get together when he has a negative test and drop the shaming. Do not leave your husband over this. That would be the stupidest decision maybe in your whole life. Through sickness and health right?  1 Corinthians 6:19-20 - a believers body belongs to God, not the government. Your husband and his family have the God given right to treat their bodies as a temple and not give it to the government to be part of an experiment. 


At the beginning of all this, when my husband got vaccinated I was actually upset because of the lack of data there was supporting how safe it is for fertility. I really want children and I was angry he would get it out of no where , pressured by his friends, without consideration about us trying to conceive. I know it might sound stupid to you, but I was truly upset. I was afraid. I can reason with you and see where you are coming from. But I let time pass and I apologized for getting upset because it was ultimately his decision. He did not become unfaithful to me because he got the vaccine or didn’t. He thought that was the best choice for his career at the time and I will respect that. As should you toward your husband wanting to wait. I didn’t get the vaccine and my husband supports me. We are very healthy people and I eat holistic foods and take supplements. We exercise and I have ivermectin if I ever do get covid. 

I understand your parents concern for their health, but in reality they will be fine around your husband even unvaccinated. If they are worried , then maybe it’s because they are worried the vaccine isn’t that effective and then why even force someone to get it in the first place !!! Resort to eating healthy, being sanitary, and have ivermectin on hand (PROVEN to cure covid). Maybe you can limit the amount of time you spend in large groups but do not limit it to zero time. Do not isolate these people or exclude them and certainly do not leave him or make him feel ashamed for this. He deserves your support. Giving him anything less is shameful of you and a huge mistake.",2021-11-10T07:35:37.000Z,no_vcc,na,na,2021-11-10T07:35:37.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid,2021-11-10T07:35:37.000Z,vcc,negative,vcc_covid

"As to the safety of ivermectin, it is prescribed to children for the treatment of lice and Norwegian scabies.  I believe it has also been used to treat other viral maladies such as Dengue fever.

"I downloaded the pdf of the paper. You can look at the tables, for example on p.7:

&gt; 60 day data -&gt; Death: 1.29% (no vaccine), 1.42% (vaccine)

This is just statistical anomaly, though, I don't really think that getting a flu shot worsens your chance of death.

edit- I think it's definitely worthwhile to get the flu shot for flu, but I'm still skeptical about this data for Covid. I think there is some plausibility in what they say is cross-reactivity to antibodies relating to ACE-2 receptor activation, however this paper said it doesn't show up in *in vivo* studies. So when you can't even see it in a petri dish, it's hard to expect you'll capture that in patients.

Increased Risk for Severe Illness from COVID-19

Although the overall risk of severe illness is low, pregnant and recently pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 when compared with non-pregnant people. Severe illness includes illness that requires hospitalization, intensive care, need for a ventilator or special equipment to breathe, or illness that results in death. Additionally, pregnant people with COVID-19 are at increased risk of preterm birth and might be at increased risk of other adverse pregnancy outcomes, compared with pregnant women without COVID-19.

Safety and Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccination during Pregnancy

￼

Evidence about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, although limited, has been growing. These data suggest that the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy.

No safety concerns were found in animal studies: Studies in animals receiving a Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J)/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns in pregnant animals or their babies.

No adverse pregnancy-related outcomes occurred in previous clinical trials that used the same vaccine platform as the J&amp;J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine: Vaccines that use the same viral vector have been given to pregnant people in all trimesters of pregnancy, including in a large-scale Ebola vaccination trial. No adverse pregnancy-related outcomes, including adverse outcomes affecting the baby, were associated with vaccination in these trials. Learn more about how viral vector vaccines work.

COVID-19 vaccines do not cause infection, including in pregnant people or their babies: None of the COVID-19 vaccines contain the live virus that causes COVID-19 so a COVID-19 vaccine cannot make anyone sick with COVID-19, including pregnant people or their babies.

Early data on the safety of receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech) during pregnancy are reassuring:

CDC released the first U.S. data on the safety of receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. The report analyzed data from three safety monitoring systems in place to gather information about COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. These early data did not find any safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or their babies.1

Another report looked at pregnant people enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry who were vaccinated before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Scientists did not find an increased risk for miscarriage among people who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy.2

Many pregnancies reported in these safety monitoring systems are ongoing. CDC will continue to follow people vaccinated during all trimesters of pregnancy to better understand effects on pregnancy and babies.

Early data suggest receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy reduces the risk for infection: A recent study from Israel compared pregnant people who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine with those who did not. Scientists found that vaccination lowered the risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19.3

Vaccination of pregnant people builds antibodies that might protect their baby: When pregnant people receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy, their bodies build antibodies against COVID-19, similar to non-pregnant people. Antibodies made after a pregnant person received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were found in umbilical cord blood. This means COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy might help protect babies against COVID-19.
